All parts of this question should be done by hand.

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Let
\[
\BD=\left[\begin{array}{cc}4&1\\1&4\end{array}\right], \quad \Bg=\left[\begin{array}{c}2\\3\end{array}\right].
\]
Use the spectral method to obtain the solution $\Bc\in\R^2$ to
\[
\BD\Bc=\Bg.
\]
\\
\item Let
\[
\BA = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0\end{array}\right], \quad 
\Bb = \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3\end{array}\right].
\]
Use the spectral method to obtain the solution $\Bx\in\R^3$ to
\[
\BA\Bx = \Bb.
\]
\end{enumerate}
