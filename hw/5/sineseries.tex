This problem concerns the same operator from class and previous problems, $L: C^2_D[0,1]\to C[0,1]$ defined by
\[ L_D u = -{d^2 u \over dx^2},\]
with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed via
\[ C^2_D[0,1] = \{ u \in C^2[0,1] : u(0) = u(1) = 0\}.\]
The eigenvalues and (normalized) eigenfunctions remain as they were before:
$\lambda_n = n^2 \pi^2$ and $\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin(n \pi x)$ for 
$n=1,2,\ldots.$ Now let $f(x) = x^2(1-x)$.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item For this $f$, compute the coefficients 
         \[ c_n = {(f,\psi_n)\over (\psi_n,\psi_n)} \]
         in the expansion
                \[ f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n \psi_n.\]
         You may determine these by hand, by consulting a table of integrals,
         or by using a symbolic mathematics package like Mathematica
         or the Symbolic Toolbox in MATLAB.  

   \item Produce a plot (or series of plots) comparing $f(x)$ 
         to the partial sums 
               \[ f_N(x) = \sum_{k=1}^N c_k \psi_k(x)\]
         for $N=1, \ldots, 10$.

   \item Plot the approximations $u_N$ to the true solution $u$ 
         that you obtain using the spectral method:
               \[ u_N(x) = \sum_{k=1}^N {c_k \over \lambda_k} \psi_k(x)\]
         for $N=1, \ldots, 10$.

   \item Now replace the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0) = u(1) = 0$ above
         with the inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions $u(0) = -1/100$ and $u(1) = 1/100$.
         Describe how to adjust your solution from part~(c) to account for these
          boundary conditions, and produce a plot of the solution with these
          inhomogeneous boundary conditions, based on $u_{10}$ from part~(c).
\end{enumerate}
