Suppose that you have a solution $u$ of the equation
  $$  a(t) {d^2 u \over dt^2}(t) + b(t) {du\over dt}(t) + c(t) u(t) = f(t)   \eqno{(4.1)} $$
and that $v$ is a nonzero solution of the homogeneous equation
  \[  a(t) {d^2 v \over dt^2}(t) + b(t) {dv\over dt}(t) + c(t) v(t) = 0. \]
Explain how to produce infinitely many different solutions of (4.1).

\ifthenelse{\boolean{showsols}}{\begin{solution}
If $v(t)$ is a nonzero solution to the homogeneous equation, 
then for any constant $\alpha$,
$\alpha v(t)$ will be a different solution 
to the same homogeneous equation, for  
  \begin{eqnarray*}
         {a(t) d^2 \over dt^2} (\alpha v) 
           + b(t) {d\over dt} (\alpha v)  + c(t) (\alpha v) 
      &=& 
         \alpha\left(a(t) {d^2v \over dt^2} + b(t) {dv\over dt}  + c(t) v\right) \\[0.5em]
      &=& \alpha\cdot 0 \\[0.5em]
      &=& 0. 
  \end{eqnarray*}
Now notice that if $u$ solves the inhomogeneous equation, 
$u$ plus any solution of the homogeneous equation will
also be a solution to the inhomogeneous equation.
In particular,
  \begin{eqnarray*}
         a(t) {d^2 \over dt^2} (u+\alpha v) 
           + b(t) {d\over dt} (u+\alpha v)  + c(t) (u+\alpha v) 
      &=& 
         \left(a(t) {d^2u \over dt^2} + b(t) {du\over dt}  + c(t) u\right) 
          + \alpha\left(a(t) {d^2v \over dt^2} + b(t) {dv\over dt}  + c(t) v\right) \\[0.5em]
      &=& f(t) + \alpha\cdot 0 \\[0.5em]
      &=& f(t). 
  \end{eqnarray*}   
Thus we can construct infinitely many solutions for the inhomogeneous equation 
of the form $u(t) + \alpha v(t)$, where $\alpha$ is any constant.

Note that this is a general result that also holds for linear 
partial differential equations.   For example, suppose that
\[ {\partial u \over \partial t} - \kappa {\partial^2 u \over \partial x^2} = f(x)\]
and 
\[ {\partial v \over \partial t} - \kappa {\partial^2 v \over \partial x^2} = 0.\]
Then, by the same reasoning we used above,
 $u(x,t) + \alpha v(x,t)$ will solve the inhomogeneous equation for any constant $\alpha$.
