Is there any \emph{constant} $f$ such that $u(t) = e^t$ is a solution of the ODE
\[ {d^2 u \over dt^2} + 4 {d u \over dt} - 3 u = f\,? \]
If so, specify $f$.  Otherwise, explain why no such $f$ exists.

\ifthenelse{\boolean{showsols}}{\begin{solution}

There exists no constant $f$ such that $u(t)=e^t$ is a solution.\\
To see this, for $u(t)=e^t$ compute $du/dt = e^t$ and $d^2u/dt^2 = e^t$.
Thus the left-hand side of this equation becomes
\[ e^t + 4e^t - 3e^t = 2e^t.\]
This formula for the left-hand side clearly depends on $t$, 
and is not equal to any constant.  
Indeed, with this left-hand side of the equation fixed, 
$u(t)=e^t$ will only be a solution of the equation
\[ {d^2 u \over dt^2} + 4 {d u \over dt} - 3 u = 2e^t.\]
