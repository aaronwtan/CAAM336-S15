Formulate a finite difference scheme using a forward in time to solve  
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t } + u - \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2 } = 0
\] 
subject to  
\[
u=x^2 \qquad at \qquad t=0 \qquad and \qquad u=1 \qquad at \qquad x=0 \qquad for \qquad t\geq 0
\] 
and
\[ 
\frac{\partial u} {\partial x}=  1-u \qquad for \qquad x=1 
\]
and complete the first step of the solution, using $h=0.2$ and $k=0.02$
