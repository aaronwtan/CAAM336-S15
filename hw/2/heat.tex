Let $u(t, x)$ satisfy the equation
\[u_t(t, x) = 4u_{xx}(t, x) + 1, \qquad 0 < x < 1,\qquad  t > 0\]
with boundary condition
\[u(t, 0) = 0,\qquad u(t, 1) = 0, \qquad (t = 0)\]
and initial condition
\[u(0, x) = 0.\]
This equation describes the temperature in a rod. The rod initially has temperature
$0'c$, and is fixed at the two end with $0'c$ (for example, in ice-water mixture). The rod is
then heated at a uniform rate $1$. The unknown $u(t, x)$ describes the temperature in the
rod over time $t$ at position $x$.\\
