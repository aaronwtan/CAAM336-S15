Consider the steady heat equation with \emph{periodic} boundary conditions
\[
-\pd{u}{x}{2} = f(x), \quad u(-1) = u(1), \quad \pd{u(-1)}{x}{} = \pd{u(1)}{x}{}.
\]
Define $C^2_P[0,1]$ as the space of $C^2$ continuous functions with periodic boundary conditions
\[
C^2_P[-1,1] = \left\{ 
u\in C^2[-1,1], \quad u(-1) = u(1), \quad \pd{u(-1)}{x}{} = \pd{u(1)}{x}{}.
\right\}
\]
and define the operator $L:C^2_P[-1,1]\rightarrow C[-1,1]$ such that $Lu = -\pd{u}{x}{2}$. Note that this operator has a zero eigenvalue with zero eigenfunction $\psi_0(x) = 1$. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Define $\phi_j, \psi_j$ 
\[
\phi_j(x) = \sin(j\pi x), \quad \psi_j(x) = \cos(j\pi x), \quad j = 1,2,\ldots.
\]
Verify that $\phi_j,\psi_j$, are also eigenfunctions of $L$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_j = (j\pi)^2$, and that linear combinations $f(x)$ of $\phi_j,\psi_j$, and $\psi_0$
\[
f(x) = d_0 + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( c_j \sin(j\pi x) + d_j \cos(j\pi x)\right)
\]
satisfy periodic boundary conditions.
\item Show for the operator $A:C^2_P[-1,1]\rightarrow C[-1,1]$, defined as
\[
Au = u + Lu = u - \pd{u}{x}{2}
\]
that $\phi_j, \psi_j$ are eigenfunctions of $A$ with eigenvalues $\mu_j = 1 + (j\pi)^2$, and that $\psi_0$ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue $\mu_0 = 1$. 
%Explain briefly why we may solve 
%\[
%u(x) - \pd{u(x)}{x}{2} = f(x)
%\]
%using the spectral method, but not the steady state heat equation $-\pd{u}{x}{2} = f(x)$.  
What difficulty arises in the spectral method due to the zero eigenvalue of the steady state heat equation?  Is this an issue with the equation $Au = f$?
\item The spectral method assumes that $f(x)$ and $u(x)$ may be represented as
\begin{align*}
f(x) = d_0 + \sum_{j = 1}^\infty \left( c_j \sin(j\pi x) + d_j \cos(j\pi x)\right),\\
u(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^\infty \left( \alpha_j \sin(j\pi x) + \beta_j \cos(j\pi x) \right).
\end{align*}
For the equation $Au = f$
\[
u(x) - \pd{u(x)}{x}{2} = f(x), \quad u(-1) = u(1), \quad \pd{u(-1)}{x}{} = \pd{u(1)}{x}{}.
\]
show that $u(x)$ is the solution if $\beta_0, \alpha_j, \beta_j$ are given by
\[
\beta_0 = d_0, \quad \alpha_j = \frac{c_j}{1+(j\pi)^2}, \quad \beta_j = \frac{d_j}{1+(j\pi)^2}.
\]
%In other words, give expressions for the coefficients $\alpha_j,\beta_j, \beta_0$ that depend on $c_j, d_j, d_0$, and $\lambda_j$ or $\mu_j$.  \emph{You may use without proof that $\phi_j, \psi_j$, and $\psi_0$ are linearly independent, or that they are orthogonal under the inner product $(f,g) = \int_0^1 f(x)g(x) dx$.}
\item Solve for $u(x)$ such that
\[
u(x) - \pd{u(x)}{x}{2} = 1 + \cos(\pi x), \quad u(-1) = u(1), \quad \pd{u(-1)}{x}{} = \pd{u(1)}{x}{}.
\]
