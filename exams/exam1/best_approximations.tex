Consider the vector space $V$ of polynomials of degree less than or equal to three.  This vector space is the span of the monomials $\left\{1,x,x^2,x^3\right\}$.  Let $\displaystyle{\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }\CV\times\CV\rightarrow\R}$ be an inner product on $V$ defined by 
\[
\ip{f,g} = \int_0^1 f(x) g(x) \, dx
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Consider the subspace $W \subset V$ of linear functions given by the span of $\left\{1,x\right\}$.  Find the best approximation $m(x) \in W$ to the function $g(x) \in V$ defined by 
\[
g(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2}
\]
by solving the $2\times2$ Gram system $Gx = b$.   You may use the fact that the inverse of a $2\times 2$ matrix is
\[
\bmatrix{a & b \cr c & d}^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc}\bmatrix{d & -b \cr -c & a}.
\]

\item Let $p(x) = a + bx$ be an arbitrary element of the subspace of linear functions $W$.  Show explicitly the orthogonality condition of the best approximation $m(x)$ holds by computing $\ip{g(x)-m(x),p(x)}$ and showing that it must be zero.

\item Since the Gram matrix is symmetric the spectral theorem guarantees that two orthogonal eigenvectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ can be found.  One such eigenvector of the Gram matrix for this problem is $v_2 = \left[\begin{array}{c} \frac{1}{3}\left(2+\sqrt{13}\right) \\ 1 \end{array}\right] $ corresponding to the linear function $v_2(x) = x + \frac{1}{3}\left(2+\sqrt{13}\right)$.  Apply the Gram-Schmidt procedure to the set of linearly independent functions $\left\{ u_1 = x, u_2 = v_2 \right\}$ to construct an alternate, orthogonal basis for $W$.  Your basis does not need to be orthonormal. 

\item Consider another subspace $Y$ of $V$ defined by the span of the following functions
\[
{\rm span}\left\{ 7, 2x, x^2 + 5x, 13x^3 \right\}.
\]
What is the best approximation $y(x)$ to $g(x)$ in $Y$, where 
\[
g(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 - x + \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Justify your answer without using any computations.
