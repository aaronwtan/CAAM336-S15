The derivation of the heat equation given at the beginning of the course arrived at the condition 
\[
\rho c \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} (x,t) + \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} = f(x)
\]
where $q(x,t)$ is the heat flux per unit volume, $\rho$ is the density of the material and $c$ is the specific heat.  The relationship of \textit{Fourier's Law}, which says that 
\[
q(x,t) = \kappa \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,t),
\]
was used to derive the heat equation.  

Suppose that an alien substance has been found, for which Fourier's law has been shown not to hold, and that scientists have determined that a slightly different relation
\[
q(x,t) = \kappa\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,t) + \beta u(x,t)
\]
describes the heat flux more accurately.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the modified, time-dependent heat equation for the newly discovered substance.  

\item Suppose a bar of length $L=1$ of the alien substance is manufactured with $\kappa = 3$, $\beta = 2$.  Determine a general formula for the steady-state termperature distribution of this bar, which should include two free constants (assume the source term $f(x)=0$). \\ \vspace{0.1em} \emph{Hint: You may wish to use the idea of ``integrating factors''.  From ordinary differential equations, for any constant $\mu$ we have}
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( u e^{\mu x}\right) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} e^{\mu x} + \mu u e^{\mu x}.
\]
\emph{You may wish to manipulate the steady state equation such that it resembles the form of the hint, and then proceed in deriving the solution.}
\item Find formulas for these free constants in the case where the following two conditions hold: the left end, at $x=0$, has a fixed \textit{heat flux} equal to $0$, i.e.
\[
q(0) = \kappa\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(0) + \beta u(0)= 0
\]
and the temperature at $x=1$ is held constant at $\delta$ degrees, so that
\[
u(1) = \delta.
\]
