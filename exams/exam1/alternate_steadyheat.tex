The derivation of the heat equation given at the beginning of the course arrived at the condition 
\[
\rho c \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} (x,t) + \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} = f(x)
\]
where $q(x,t)$ is the heat flux per unit volume, $\rho$ is the density of the material and $c$ is the specific heat.  The relationship of \textit{Fourier's Law}, which says that 
\[
q(x,t) = \kappa \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,t),
\]
was used to derive the heat equation.  An alien substance has been found for which Fourier's law has been shown not to hold.  However, scientists have determined that a slightly different relation
\[
q(x,t) = \kappa\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x,t) + \beta u(x,t)
\]
does describe the heat flux.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write the modified, time-dependent heat equation for the newly discovered substance.  

\item Suppose a bar of length $L$ of the alien substance is manufactured with $\kappa = 3$, $\beta = 2$.  Determine a general formula for the steady-state termperature distribution of this bar, which should include two free constants.  (Assume no additional source term f(x) is present). Hint: What is the solution of the ordinary differential equation $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}y(x) = y(x)$? 

\item Find formulas for these free constants in the case where the following two conditions hold: the left end, at $x=0$, has a fixed \textit{heat flux} equal to $0$ (i.e. q(0) = 0 where q(x) is the heat flux function given above) and the temperature at $x=L$ is held constant at $\delta$ degrees.
