In class we considered inner products for vectors in $\R^n$ and
functions in $C[0,1]$, and used these inner products to generate
best approximations.  
This problem will introduce you to an inner product of \emph{matrices} 
in $\R^{n\times n}$.
(Related math arises in many modern applications;
e.g., at the roots of how Netflix recommends movies.) 

      Let $V = \R^{2\times 2}$, the set of all $2\times 2$ matrices,
      and define the inner product for matrices as
      \[ (\BA,\BB) = \sum_{j=1}^2 \sum_{k=1}^2 a_{jk} b_{jk},\]
       where
      \[ \BA = \bmatrix{a_{11} & a_{12} \cr a_{21} & a_{22}}, \quad
         \BB = \bmatrix{b_{11} & b_{12} \cr b_{21} & b_{22}}.\]
%      With this inner product we associate the norm $\|\BA\| = \sqrt{(\BA,\BA)}$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Verify that $(\cdot, \cdot)$ is an inner product on $V=\R^{2\times 2}$.
\vspace*{1em}
\item Given that $V$ (the set of all possible $2\times 2$ matrices) is a vector space, show that the set $V_s$ of all symmetric $2\times 2$ matrices
\[
V_s = \left\{ \BA =   \bmatrix{a_{11} & a_{12} \cr a_{21} & a_{22}} \in \R^{2\times 2}, \qquad a_{12} = a_{21}\right\}
\]
is a subspace of $V$.
\vspace*{1em}
\item Consider the operators $S: \R^{2\times 2} \rightarrow \R^{2\times 2}$ and $K: \R^{2\times 2} \rightarrow \R^{2\times 2}$ 
\[
S(\BA) = \BA + \BA^T, \qquad K(\BA) = \BA - \BA^T,
\]
where $\BA^T$ is the matrix transpose 
\[
\BA^T = \bmatrix{a_{11} & a_{21} \cr a_{12} & a_{22}}.
\]
Show that both of these operators are linear operators.  
\item Show that, for any $\BA\in \R^{2\times 2}$, 
\[
S(K(\BA)) = K(S(\BA)) = {\bf 0}
\]
where $\bf 0$ is the $2\times 2$ zero matrix.  Use this fact to explain how the range and null space of $S$ and range and null space of $K$ are related.
%\textcolor{red}{Todo: finish, add something about the null space of each operator and how that implies that $S(K(\BA)) = K(S(\BA)) = 0$.  }

%\item Consider the subspace of $V$ consisting of all symmetric matrices:
%      \[  V_3 = {\rm span}\bigg\{ 
%       \bmatrix{1 & 0 \cr 0 & 0}, 
%       \bmatrix{0 & 0 \cr 0 & 1}, 
%       \bmatrix{0 & 1 \cr 1 & 0}\bigg\}.\]
%      
%      Compute the best approximation $\BM_3$ to the matrix
%      \[ \BM = \bmatrix{ 1 & 3 \cr 7 & 9}\]
%      from the subspace $V_3$.
%
%\item Now let $\BM\in\R^{2\times2}$ be any $2\times 2$ matrix, and let
%           $\BM_3$ be its best approximation from $V_3$.
%           Explain why the error $\BM-\BM_3$ must \emph{always} have zero 
%           diagonal entries.
%
%\item Now consider the subspace
%      \[  \widehat{V}_3 = {\rm span}\Bigg\{ 
%       \bmatrix{{1\over\sqrt{2}}  & 0 \cr 0 & {1\over \sqrt{2}}}, 
%       \bmatrix{{1\over\sqrt{10}} & {2\over\sqrt{10}} \cr {2\over\sqrt{10}} & {1\over \sqrt{10}}}, 
%       \bmatrix{{1\over\sqrt{2}} & 0 \cr 0 & -{1\over\sqrt{2}}}\Bigg\}.\]
%       What is the best approximation $\widehat{\BM}_3$ from $\widehat{V}_3$ to 
%      \[ \BM = \bmatrix{ 1 & 3 \cr 7 & 9}\,?\]
%
%\item Write down a basis for the set of symmetric matrices in $\R^{3\times 3}$ (i.e., $3\times 3$ matrices).\\
%       In general, what is the dimension of the set of symmetric matrices
%       in $\R^{n\times n}$?
\end{enumerate}
