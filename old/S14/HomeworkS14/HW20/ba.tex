All parts of this question should be done by hand.

Let $\phi_1\in C[-1,1]$, $\phi_2\in C[-1,1]$, $f_1\in C[-1,1]$, and $f_2\in C[-1,1]$ be defined by
\[
\phi_1(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
\[
\phi_2(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}x,
\]
\[
f_1(x) = \sin(\pi x),
\]
and
\[
f_2(x) = \cos(\pi x),
\]
for all $x\in[-1,1]$. Note that $\{\phi_1,\phi_2\}$ is linearly independent. Let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[-1,1]\times C[-1,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\ip{u,v} = \int_{-1}^1 u(x)v(x)\, dx
\]
and let the norm $\norm{\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[-1,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\norm{u} = \sqrt{\ip{u,u}}.
\]
Note that $\{\phi_1,\phi_2\}$ is orthonormal with respect to the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}$. Also, let $\psi_1\in C[0,1]$, $\psi_2\in C[0,1]$, $g_1\in C[0,1]$, and $g_2\in C[0,1]$ be defined by
\[
\psi_1(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},
\]
\[
\psi_2(x) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{2}}x,
\]
\[
g_1(x) = \sin(\pi x),
\]
and
\[
g_2(x) = \cos(\pi x),
\]
for all $x\in[0,1]$. Note that $\{\psi_1,\psi_2\}$ is linearly independent.  Let the inner product $B\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\times C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
B\ip{u,v} = \int_0^1 u(x)v(x)\, dx
\]
and let the norm $\norm{\cdot}_B:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\norm{u}_B = \sqrt{B\ip{u,u}}.
\]
Note that
\[
\ip{f_1,\phi_2}={\sqrt{6}\over \pi},
\]
\[
B\ip{g_1,\psi_1}={\sqrt{2}\over \pi},
\]
\[
B\ip{g_1,\psi_2}={\sqrt{6}\over 2\pi},
\]
\[
B\ip{g_2,\psi_2}=-{\sqrt{6}\over \pi^2},
\]
and
\[
\ip{f_1,\phi_1}=\ip{f_2,\phi_1}=\ip{f_2,\phi_2}=B\ip{g_2,\psi_1}=0.
\]
