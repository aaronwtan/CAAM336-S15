Let the norm $\norm{\cdot}:\mbox{ }\R^2\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\norm{\By} = \sqrt{\By\cdot \By}.
\]
Let the timestep $\Delta t\in\R$ be such that $\Delta t>0$ and let $t_k=k\Delta t$ for $k=0,1,2,\ldots$. Let
\[
\BA = \left[\begin{array}{cc}0 & 1 \cr -1 & 0\end{array}\right]
\]
and consider the problem of finding $\Bx(t)$ such that
\[
\Bx'(t) = \BA\Bx(t),\quad t\ge 0
\]
and
\[
\Bx(0) = \left[\begin{array}{c}1 \\ 1\end{array}\right].
\]
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\Bx(t)$. Note that for real numbers $t$, 
\[
e^{i t} = \cos(t) + i\sin(t)
\]
and
\[
e^{-i t} = \cos(t) - i\sin(t).
\]
\\
\item How does $\norm{\Bx(t)}$ behave as $t$ increases?
\\
\item For $k=0,1,2,\ldots$, let $\Bx_k$ be the approximation to $\Bx(t_k)$ obtained using the forward Euler method. For all choices of the timestep $\Delta t>0$, how will $\norm{\Bx_k}$ behave as $k\rightarrow\infty$?
\\
\item For $k=0,1,2,\ldots$, let $\Bx_k$ be the approximation to $\Bx(t_k)$ obtained using the backward Euler method. For all choices of the timestep $\Delta t>0$, how will $\norm{\Bx_k}$ behave as $k\rightarrow\infty$?
\end{enumerate}
