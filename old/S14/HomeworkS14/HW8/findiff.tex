\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider the forward difference approximation
\[
u'(x) \approx {u(x+h) - u(x) \over h}.
\]
For $u(x) = \exp(2x)$, compute (in MATLAB) the error
\[
\Big| u'(1/2) -  {u(1/2+h) - u(1/2) \over h}\Big|,
\]
for $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512$ (powers of~2) with $h=1/(N+1)$. When $h$ is small enough, this error should be proportional to $h$. Present your results in a table like the one below but with the missing entries filled in.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|r}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{$N$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{error} \\
\hline
   2 &  2.2920610 \\
   4 &   \\
   8 &   \\
  16 &   \\
  32 &   \\
  64 &   \\
 128 &   \\
 256 &   \\
 512 &  
\end{tabular}\end{center}

\item Consider the centered difference approximation
\[
u'(x) \approx {u(x+h) - u(x-h) \over 2 h}.
\]
For $u(x) = \exp(2x)$, compute (in MATLAB) the error
\[
\Big| u'(1/2) -  {u(1/2+h) - u(1/2-h) \over 2h}\Big|
\]
for $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512$ with $h=1/(N+1)$. When $h$ is small enough, this error should be proportional to $h^2$. Present your results in a table like the one below but with the missing entries filled in.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r|r}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{c|}{$N$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{error} \\
\hline
   2 &  0.4117528 \\
   4 &   \\
   8 &   \\
  16 &   \\
  32 &   \\
  64 &   \\
 128 &   \\
 256 &   \\
 512 &  
\end{tabular}\end{center}

\item Use MATLAB's \verb|loglog| command to produce a plot of the error for the approximations considered in part~(a) and part~(b) for $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512$. Use the \verb|hold on| command so that the plot showing the errors from part (a) is on the same figure as the plot showing the errors from part (b).
\\
\item By inspecting the plot you have created, estimate the value of $N$ that you need to approximate $u'(1/2)$ to an error of $10^{-2}$ using the approximations in part~(a) and part~(b).
