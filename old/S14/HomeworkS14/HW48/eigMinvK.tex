for $j=1,\ldots,N$. Let $V_N={\rm span}\{\phi_1,...,\phi_N\}$. Let $\rho\in C[0,1]$ be such that $\rho(x)>0$ for all $x\in[0,1]$, let $c\in C[0,1]$ be such that $c(x)>0$ for all $x\in[0,1]$ and let $\kappa\in C[0,1]$ be such that $\kappa(x)>0$ for all $x\in[0,1]$. Let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:L^2(0,1)\times L^2(0,1)\to\R$ be defined by
\[
\ip{u,v}=\int_0^1\rho(x)c(x)u(x)v(x)\,dx
\]
and let the inner product $a\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:H^1_D(0,1)\times H^1_D(0,1)\to\R$ be defined by
\[
a\ip{u,v}=\int_0^1\kappa(x)u'(x)v'(x)\,dx.

Let $\BM\in\R^{N\times N}$ be the matrix with entries
\[
M_{jk}=\ip{\phi_k,\phi_j}
\]
and let $\BK\in\R^{N\times N}$ be the matrix with entries
\[
K_{jk}=a\ip{\phi_k,\phi_j}.
\]
For $\Bw\in\R^N$, let
\[
\hat{w}_N=\sum_{j=1}^Nw_j\phi_j
\]
where $w_j\in\R$ is the $j$th entry of the vector $\Bw$.

In class we had stated that the eigenvalues of $\BM^{-1}\BK$ are real. In class we had also stated that the eigenvalues of $-\BM^{-1}\BK$ are negative since the eigenvalues of $\BM^{-1}\BK$ are positive. This question will walk you through the process of showing that the eigenvalues of $\BM^{-1}\BK$ are positive given that we know that the eigenvalues of $\BM^{-1}\BK$ are real.
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $\Bw\in\R^N$, show that
\[
\Bw^T\BM\Bw=\ip{\hat{w}_N,\hat{w}_N}.
\]
\\
\item Show that if $\BM^{-1}\BK\Bw=\lambda\Bw$, for $\lambda\in\R$ and $\Bw\in\R^N$, then
\[
a\ip{\hat{w}_N,\hat{w}_N}=\lambda\ip{\hat{w}_N,\hat{w}_N}.
\]
In addition to the information given previously in the question you may use the fact that
\[
\Bw^T\BK\Bw=a\ip{\hat{w}_N,\hat{w}_N}.
\]
\\
\item Use the properties satisfied by inner products to show that if $\lambda\in\R$ is an eigenvalue of $\BM^{-1}\BK$ then $\lambda>0$.
\end{enumerate}
