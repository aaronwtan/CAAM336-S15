Consider the temperature function
\[
u(x,t) = e^{-\kappa \theta^2 t/(\rho c)} \sin(\theta x)
\]
for constant $\kappa$, $\rho$, $c$, and $\theta$.
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that this function $u(x,t)$ is a solution of the homogeneous heat equation
 \[
\rho c {\d u \over \d t} = \kappa {\d^2 u\over \d x^2},\quad\mbox{for }0<x<\ell\mbox{ and all }t.
\]
\\
\item For which values of $\theta$ will $u$ satisfy homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions at $x=0$ and~$x=\ell$?
\\
\item Suppose $\kappa = 2.37\;\mbox{W/(cm K)}$, $\rho = 2.70\;\mbox{g/cm}^3$, and $c = 0.897\; \mbox{J/(g K)}$ (approximate values for aluminum found on Wikipedia), and that the bar has length $\ell = 10\;\mbox{cm}$. Let $\theta$ be such that $u(x,t)$ satisfies homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions as in part~(b) and $u(x,t)>0$ for $0<x<\ell$ and all $t$. Use MATLAB to plot the solution $u(x,t)$  for $0\le x\le \ell$ at times $t = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20$ seconds, superimposing all six plots on the same axis.
\end{enumerate}
