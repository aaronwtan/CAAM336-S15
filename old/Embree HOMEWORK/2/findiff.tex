\begin{enumerate}
\item In class we considered the `forward difference' approximation
      \[ u'(x) \approx {u(x+h) - u(x) \over h}.\]
      Let $u(x) = \exp(2x)$.  For each value 
      $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots, 512$ (powers of~2), compute (in MATLAB) the error
         \[ \Big| u'(1/2) -  {u(1/2+h) - u(1/2) \over h}\Big|,\]
      where $h = 1/(N+1)$.
      Print out these errors (in a table), and use MATLAB's \verb|loglog| command to 
      produce a plot of $N$ versus the corresponding error.
      (In class, we showed that this error should be proportional to $h$
       as $h\to 0$.)
      
\vspace*{1em} 
\item Consider the `centered difference' approximation
      \[ u'(x) \approx {u(x+h) - u(x-h) \over 2 h}.\]
      Repeat part~(a) with this approximation:
      That is, for $u(x) = \exp(2x)$, compute the error
         \[ \Big| u'(1/2) -  {u(1/2+h) - u(1/2-h) \over 2h}\Big|\]
      for $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots, 512$ (powers of~2) with $h=1/(N+1)$.  
      Print out these errors (in a table), and use MATLAB's \verb|loglog| command to 
      produce a plot of $N$ versus the corresponding error.
      (In class, we showed that this error should be proportional to $h^2$
       as $h\to 0$.)

      \emph{Use the {\tt hold on} command to superimpose the plot for~(b)
      on your plot for part~(a):  you should only turn in one plot for
      this problem.}      

\item By inspecting the plot you have created, estimate the value of $N$ that you
      need to approximate $u'(1/2)$ to an error of $10^{-2}$ using the methods
      in part~(a) and part~(b).
\end{enumerate}

\vspace*{2em}
Challenge problem (4 bonus points):  Given an integer $N\ge 1$, 
define $h = 1/(N+1)$ and consider the grid of points $x_j = jh$
for $j=0, \ldots, N+1$.
It is often desirable to construct an
approximation to $u'(x_0)$ whose accuracy is proportional to $h^2$
as $h\to0$.  
The centered difference in part~(b)
above is unsuitable, as it would require a value $u(x_{-1}) = u(-h)$, and
$-h$ is outside the domain $[0,1]$.
Show an alternative way to approximate
$u'(x_0)$ using only the values $u(x_0)$, $u(x_1)$, and $u(x_2)$, i.e.,
find coefficients $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ such that
\[ u'(x_0) = \alpha u(x_0) + \beta u(x_1) + \gamma u(x_2) + O(h^2).\]
