Consider the following sets of functions.
Demonstrate whether or not each is a vector space\\
(with addition and scalar multiplication defined in the obvious way).

\begin{enumerate}
   \item $\{\Bx \in \R^2 : x_2^{} = x_1^3\}$
   \item $\{\Bx \in \R^3 : x_1 + 2x_2 + 3 x_3 = 0\}$
   \item $\{f \in C[0,1]: \mbox{$f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x\in [0,1]$}\}$
   \item $\{f \in C[0,1]: \mbox{$\max_{x\in[0,1]} f(x) \le 1$}\}$
   \item $\{f \in C^1[0,1]: \mbox{$f'(0) = 0$}\}$
   \item $\{f \in C^2[0,1]: \mbox{$f''(x) = 0$ for all $x\in[0,1]$}\}$

\begin{enumerate}
\item This set \emph{is not} a vector space.\\
      The vector $\displaystyle{\Bx = \bmatrix{1\cr 1}}$ 
      is in the set, yet $\displaystyle{2\Bx = \bmatrix{2\cr 2}}$ 
      is not, since $2 \ne 2^3 = 8$.
      
\item This set \emph{is} a vector space.\\
      Suppose $\Bx$ and $\By$ are members of this set.
      Then $x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0$ and  $y_1 + 2y_2 + 3y_3 = 0$.
      Adding these two equations gives
        \[ (x_1+y_1) + 2(x_2+y_2) + 3(x_3+y_3) = 0,\]
      and hence $\Bx + \By$ is also in the set.
      Multiplying $x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0$ by an arbitrary constant 
      $\alpha\in\R$ gives
        \[ (\alpha x_1) + 2(\alpha x_2) + 3(\alpha x_3) = 0,\]
      and hence $\alpha \Bx$ is also in the set.

\item This set \emph{is not} a vector space.\\
      The function $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$ is in the set, but
      a scalar multiple, $-1\cdot f(x) = -1$ for all $x$,
      takes negative values and thus violates the requirement 
      for membership in the set.

\item This set \emph{is not} a vector space.\\
      The function $f(x) = 1$ for all $x$ is in the set, but
      a scalar multiple, $2\cdot f(x) = 2$ for all $x$,
      takes values greater than~1 and thus violates the requirement
      for membership in the set.

\item This set \emph{is} vector space.\\
      If $f$ and $g$ are in the set, then $f'(0)=g'(0)=0$, so 
       \[ {d (f+g)\over dx}(0) = f'(0)+g'(0) = 0+0 = 0.\]
      Similarly, for any scalar $\alpha$, 
       \[ {d (\alpha f)\over dx}(0) = \alpha f'(0) = \alpha\cdot 0 = 0.\]

\item This set \emph{is} a vector space.\\
      Suppose $f$ and $g$ are both members of this set.
      Then 
          \[ {d^2 (f+g) \over dx^2} 
               = {d^2 f \over d x^2} + {d^2 g\over dx^2} 
               = 0+0 = 0,\]
      and thus $f+g$ is in the set. 
      For any $\alpha \in \R$ note that
           \[ {d^2 (\alpha f) \over dx^2} = \alpha {d^2 f\over dx^2} = \alpha\cdot 0 = 0,\]
      and hence $\alpha f$ is also in the set.  

      Said another way:  any member of the set must be a function of
      the form $f(x) = \beta + \gamma x$, i.e., a line.
      The addition of two lines is still a line, and 
        a scalar multiple of a line is also a line.
