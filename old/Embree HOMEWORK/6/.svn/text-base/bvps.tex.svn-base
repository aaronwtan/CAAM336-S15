Solve the following boundary value problems using the spectral method.\\
For each problem, (i) write down the expansions of the right hand side
functions as linear combinations of the eigenfunctions; 
(ii) write down the sum for the solution $u$ obtained from the spectral method;
and (iii) produce a plot showing the sum of the first twenty terms in the series for $u$.

For parts~(c)--(e) you may use the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
computed in Problem~1(d) of Problem Set~5, and the results of Section~5.2.3
of the text.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item $\displaystyle{-{d^2 u \over dx^2}(x) = e^x}$, 
      \quad $u(0) = 1$, $u(1) = 0$.\\[0.25em]
\item $\displaystyle{-{d^2 u \over dx^2}(x) - 10 u(x) = e^x}$, 
      \quad $u(0) = 0$, $u(1) = 0$.\\[0.25em]
\item $\displaystyle{-{d^2 u \over dx^2}(x) = x + \sin(\pi x)}$, 
      \quad $\displaystyle{u(0) = {du\over dx}(1) = 0.}$ \\[0.25em]
\item $\displaystyle{-{d^2 u \over dx^2}(x) = x + \sin(\pi x)}$, 
      \quad $\displaystyle{u(0) = {du\over dx}(1) = 1.}$ \\[0.25em]
\item $\displaystyle{-{d^2 u \over dx^2}(x) = f(x)}$, 
      \quad $\displaystyle{{du\over dx}(0) = u(1) = 0,}$ 
      where $\displaystyle{f(x) 
             = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 1, & 0<x<1/2;\\ 
                                         0, & 1/2<x<1.
                \end{array}\right.}$ \\[0.25em]
      (This $f$ is not continuous; follow the usual procedure and
       see if you obtain a sensible answer.)

\def\uhat{\widehat{u}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First we solve the problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions
using the spectral method, then we will add a correction to satisfy the
inhomogeneous boundary conditions.  

For the operator with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions, 
we have eigenvalues $\lambda_k = k^2 \pi^2$ with associated
(normalized) eigenfunctions $u_k(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin(k\pi x)$.
We shall call the solution to the problem with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions 
$\uhat$, which is given by the spectral method
\[ \uhat = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\ip{f,u_k} \over \lambda_k} u_k.\]
To compute $\ip{e^x,u_k}$, integrate twice by parts to obtain
\begin{eqnarray*}
     \int_0^1 e^x \sqrt{2} \sin(k\pi x) \, d x
       &=& \sqrt{2} \big[e^x \sin(k\pi x) \big]_0^1 
          - {\sqrt{2} \over k\pi} \int_0^1 e^x \cos(k\pi x)\,dx \\[0.5em]
       &=& -{\sqrt{2} \over k\pi} \int_0^1 e^x \cos(k\pi x)\,dx \\[0.5em]
       &=& -{\sqrt{2} \over k\pi} 
           \Big(\big[e^x \cos(k\pi x)\big]_0^1
                   + {1\over k\pi} \int_0^1 e^x \sin(k\pi x)\,dx \Big)\\[0.5em]
       &=& {\sqrt{2}\over k\pi} \big(1-e (-1)^k\big)
                -{\sqrt{2}\over k^2\pi^2} 
                   \int_0^1 e^x \sin(k\pi x)\,dx,
\end{eqnarray*}
from which we discern that
\[\sqrt{2}\Big({1+{1\over k^2\pi^2}}\Big) \int_0^1 e^x \sin(k\pi x)\,dx
        = {\sqrt{2}\over k\pi} (1-(-1)^k e).\]
We conclude that
\[ \ip{f,u_k} = \int_0^1 e^x \sqrt{2} \sin(k\pi x) \, d x
              = {\sqrt{2} k\pi \over 1+k^2\pi^2} (1-(-1)^k e).\]
The spectral method thus gives
\[ \uhat = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\ip{f,u_k} \over \lambda_k} u_k
         = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {2(1-(-1)^k e)\over k\pi(1+k^2\pi^2)} \sin(k\pi x).\]
Now we need to add some function $w$ to $\uhat$ that will produce a $u = \uhat+w$
that satisfies both the differential equation and the inhomogeneous boundary conditions.
We want
\[ -{d^2 u \over dx^2} = -{d^2 \uhat \over dx^2} - {d^2 w \over dx^2} = e^x,\]
but since we already have
\[ -{d^2 \uhat \over dx^2} = e^x,\]
we need 
\[ -{d^2 w \over dx^2} = 0.\]
In other words, $w$ must be for the form $w(x) = \alpha + \beta x$ for 
some constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Now note that
\[ u(0) = \uhat(0) + w(0) = 0+w(0), \qquad
   u(1) = \uhat(1) + w(1) = 0+w(1), \]
so to satisfy the inhomogeneous conditions we need
\[ w(0) = 1, \qquad w(1) = 0.\]
This is only satisfied if we take $\alpha = 1$, $\beta = -1$.
The final series formula for $u$ is thus
\[ u(x) = 1 - x + \sum_{k=1}^\infty {2(1-(-1)^k e)\over k\pi(1+k^2\pi^2)} \sin(k\pi x).\]

Though it is not asked for in the problem, the exact solution is
\[ u(x) = -e^x + (e-1)x + 2.\]
The plots below compare the exact solution to the partial sums involving
$0$, 1, 2, and 20 terms.  The code that produced the plots follows.

\item To solve this problem, identify the linear operator as
\[ L u = -u'' - 10 u,\]
acting the space $C^2_D[0,1]$.  To find the eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ and eigenfunctions $u_k$,
notice that $L u_k = \lambda_k u_k$ is equivalent to
\[ -u_k'' - 10 u_k = \lambda_k u_k,\]
which can be rewritten as
\[ -u_k'' = (\lambda_k + 10) u_k.\]
Thus, the eigenfunctions $u_k$ will be the same as our usual eigenfunctions for $-u''$ on
$C^2_D[0,1]$: 
\[ u_k(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin(k \pi x).\]
The eigenvalues must satisfy $\lambda_k + 10 = k^2 \pi^2$, in other words,
\[ \lambda_k = k^2\pi^2 - 10.\]
Now we are prepared to solve the problem using the spectral method.  
Since the right hand side $f(x) = e^x$ is the same as in part~(a), 
and the eigenfunctions are the same, we can simply use the expression
we have already derived:
\[ f(x) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\ip{f,u_k} \over \ip{u_k,u_k}} u_k
         = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {2(1-(-1)^k e) k \pi \over (1+k^2\pi^2)} \sin(k\pi x).\]
To get the solution $u(x)$, we merely divide each term in the series for $f$ by the eigenvalues:
\[ u(x) = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {\ip{f,u_k} \over \ip{u_k,u_k}} {1\over \lambda_k} u_k
         = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {2(1-(-1)^k e) k \pi \over (1+k^2\pi^2)(k^2\pi^2 - 10)} \sin(k\pi x).\]
The plots below compare the exact solution to the partial sums involving
1, 2, and 20 terms, along with the error in the 20-term approximation.  
Code to produce these plots follows.  
The first term in the series gives an excellent approximation!  Why?
Because when $k=1$, the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1 = \pi^2- 10\approx -0.130$ 
is quite a bit smaller than $\lambda_2 = 4\pi^2 - 10 \approx 29.478$, so 
the first term is quite a bit larger than the next one.

 \item One can readily compute (or look up in the textbook) 
      the eigenvalues and (orthonormal) eigenfunctions for these boundary conditions:
     \begin{eqnarray*} \lambda_k &=& (k-1/2)^2 \pi^2, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots \\[0.5em]
                        u_k &=& \sqrt{2} \sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x).
      \end{eqnarray*}
     We now need to compute the inner products $\ip{x+\sin(\pi x), u_k}$, which we can do
     in pieces:
     \begin{eqnarray*} 
          \ip{x, u_k} &=& \sqrt{2} \int_0^1 x \sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x) \, dx  \\[0.5em]
                      &=& {\sqrt{2}(\sqrt{\lambda_k}\cos(\sqrt{\lambda_k})+\sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k})
                               \over \lambda_k}
                      = {\sqrt{2}(-1)^{k+1} \over \lambda_k}.
     \end{eqnarray*}
     twice integrating by parts shows that
       \[ \int_0^1 \sin(\alpha x) \sin(\beta)x\, dx
             = {\alpha \cos(\alpha)\sin(\beta) - \beta\sin(\alpha)\cos(\beta) 
                    \over \beta^2-\alpha^2},\]
     and hence
       \[   \ip{\sin(\pi x), u_k} = {\sqrt{2} (-1)^k \over ((k-1/2)^2-1)\pi}
                                  = {\sqrt{2} (-1)^k \pi\over (\lambda_k - \pi^2)}.\]
     We put these pieces together to find that
       \[   \ip{x+\sin(\pi x), u_k} = 
                  {\sqrt{2}(-1)^{k+1} \over \lambda_k}
                + {\sqrt{2} (-1)^k \pi\over (\lambda_k - \pi^2)}.\]

The spectral method thus gives the formula
\begin{eqnarray*}
     u(x) &=& \sum_{k=1}^\infty 
                  2(-1)^k\Big({\pi\over \lambda_k(\lambda_k - \pi^2)} 
                               - {1\over \lambda_k^2}\Big)
                              \sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x) \\[0.5em]
          &=& \sum_{k=1}^\infty 
                   {2 (-1)^k \big((\pi-1)\lambda_k - \pi^2\big)
                     \over \lambda_k^2(\lambda_k-\pi^2)}
                              \sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x).
\end{eqnarray*}
The true solution can be determined to be
\[ u(x) = {\sin(\pi x) \over \pi^2} -{x^3 \over 6} + {x\over 2} + {x\over \pi}.\]
The plots below compare the exact solution to the partial sums involving
1, 2, 3, and 20 terms.  The code that produced the plots follows.

\item Notice that this problem is identical to part~(c), except
now with the inhomogeneous boundary conditions $u(0) = u'(1) = 1$.
As in part~(a), we seek a solution $u = \widehat{u} + w$, where
$\widehat{u}$ satisfies the equation with homogeneous boundary conditions
(from part~(c)),
\begin{eqnarray*}
    \widehat{u}(x)
          &=& \sum_{k=1}^\infty 
                   {2 (-1)^k \big((\pi-1)\lambda_k - \pi^2\big)
                     \over \lambda_k^2(\lambda_k-\pi^2)}
                              \sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x) \\
          &=& {\sin(\pi x) \over \pi^2} -{x^3 \over 6} + {x\over 2} + {x\over \pi},
\end{eqnarray*}
and $w$ is a function with $-w''(x) = 0$, i.e., $w(x) = \alpha + \beta x$.
In this case we require 
\[ u(0) = \widehat{u}(0) + w(0) = \alpha = 1\]
and 
\[ u'(1) = \widehat{u}'(1) + w'(0) = beta = 1.\]
Hence, the solution is given by
\begin{eqnarray*}
   u(x) &=& 1 + x + 
             \sum_{k=1}^\infty 
                   {2 (-1)^k \big((\pi-1)\lambda_k - \pi^2\big)
                     \over \lambda_k^2(\lambda_k-\pi^2)}
                              \sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x) \\
        &=& 1 + x + {\sin(\pi x) \over \pi^2} -{x^3 \over 6} + {x\over 2} + {x\over \pi}.
\end{eqnarray*}
The plots below compare the exact solution to the partial sums involving
1, 2, 3, and 20 terms.  The code that produced the plots follows.

\item On Problem Set~5, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for this example
      were determined to be
     \begin{eqnarray*} \lambda_k &=& (k-1/2)^2 \pi^2, \quad k = 1, 2, \ldots \\[0.5em]
                        u_k &=& \sqrt{2} \cos(\lambda_k x).
      \end{eqnarray*}
Though the function $f$ is discontinuous, we proceed as usual, computing
\begin{eqnarray*}
     \ip{f,u_k} = \int_0^1 f(x) u_k(x)\,dx  
                &=& \int_0^{1/2} u_k(x)\,dx \\
                &=& \int_0^{1/2} \sqrt{2}@\cos(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x)\,dx 
                = \sqrt{2}@\Big[{\sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k} x) 
                                   \over \sqrt{\lambda_k}}\Big]_0^{1/2} 
                = {\sqrt{2}@\sin(\sqrt{\lambda_k}/2)\over \sqrt{\lambda_k}}.
\end{eqnarray*}
\textbf{Note the slow decay} of these coefficients, even though $f$ satisfies
the same boundary conditions as the eigenfunctions!  This is due to the 
discontinuity on the interior of the domain, as seen in the following plots.

The spectral method thus gives the solution as the formula
\[ u(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty = {2 \sin({\lambda_k}/2) \over \lambda_k^{3/2}}
                                 \cos(\lambda_k x).\]
