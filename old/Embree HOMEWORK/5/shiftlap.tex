Consider the linear operator $L:C_D^2[0,\ell] \to C[0,\ell]$, where
\[ L u = -{d^2 \over dx^2} u + 7u\]
and 

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Prove that this operator is symmetric.
   \item Using question~1 or otherwise, determine the
         eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $L$.
   \item Use the spectral method to determine the solution to the
         differential equation
           \[ -{d^2 \over dx^2} u + 7 u = \cos(x), \qquad u(0)=u(1)=0.\]
\end{enumerate}
