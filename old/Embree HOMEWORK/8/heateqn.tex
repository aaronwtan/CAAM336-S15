Consider the function

Recall that the eigenvalues of the operator $L: C_N^2[0,1] \to C[0,1]$,
          \[ L u = -u'' \]
      are $\lambda_n = n^2 \pi^2$ for $n=0, 1, \ldots$ 
      with associated (normalized) eigenfunctions $\psi_0(x) = 1$ and 
      \[ \psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2} \cos(n\pi x), \qquad n = 1, 2, \ldots.\]
      We wish to write $u_0(x)$ as a series of the form
           \[ u_0(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(0) \psi_n(x),\]
      where $a_n(0) = (u_0, \psi_n)$.

\item To expand $u_0(x)$ in the form
          \[ u_0(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(0) \psi_n(x),\]
      we must compute the coefficients $a_n(0)$.  
      For $n=0$ we compute 
        \[ a_0(0) = \int_0^1 u_0(x)\cdot 1\, \dop x 
                  = \int_0^{1/3} 1\,\dop x + \int_{2/3}^1 1\,\dop x = 2/3.\]
      For $n>0$ we have
      \begin{eqnarray*}
            a_n(0) &=& \sqrt{2} \int_0^1 u_0(x)\cos(n\pi x)\, dx  \\[0.5em]
                   &=& \sqrt{2}\Big(\int_0^{1/3} \cos(n\pi x)\, dx
                  +          \int_{2/3}^1 \cos(n\pi x)\, dx\Big) \\[0.5em]
                   &=& \sqrt{2}\Big(\Big[{\sin(n\pi x)\over n\pi}\Big]_0^{1/3}
                                   +\Big[{\sin(n\pi x)\over n\pi}\Big]_{2/3}^1 \\[0.5em]
                   &=& {\sqrt{2}(\sin(n\pi/3) - \sin(2n\pi/3)) \over n\pi}.
      \end{eqnarray*}
      [GRADERS: this last expression is sufficiently simplified for full credit.]

      Note that $\sin(2n\pi/3) = 2 \sin(n\pi/3)\cos(n\pi/3)$, and hence
       \[ \sin(n\pi/3) - \sin(2n\pi/3) = \sin(n\pi/3)(1-2\cos(n\pi/3)).\]
      Thus we have $a_n(0) = 0$ in two cases: if $n$ is a multiple of~3, 
      or if $\cos(n\pi/3) = 1/2$.  The former occurs when $n=3, 6, 9, 12, 15, \ldots$,
      whiles the latter occurs when 
        $n\pi/3 ({\rm mod}\ 2\pi) = \pi/3 \mbox{ or } 5\pi/3$,
      and hence $a_n(0) = 0$ when $n = 1+6p$ for integers $p\ge 0$ or 
      $n=-1+6p$ for integers $p\ge 1$.
      Together, this implies that for all odd integers $n$, $a_n(0)=0$.
      We end up with the partial sums shown in the following figure.
      (MATLAB code follows at the end of this solution.)

\item 
  We seek a series solution of the form
     \[ u(x,t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(t) \psi_n(x).\]
  Using standard techniques described in class, together with the
      fact the the problem is inhomogeneous ($f(x,t) = 0$), 
      we find that
        \[ a'_n(t) + \lambda_n a_n(t) = 0.\]
      For $n=0$ we have
        \[ a'_0(t) = 0,\]
      and hence $a_0(t)$ is constant, so we conclude $a_0(t) = a_0(0) = 2/3$.
      For $n\ge 1$ we have
        \[ a_n(t) = e^{-\lambda_n t} a_n(0),\]
      where $\lambda_n = n^2\pi^2$.
      In sum, we have
        \[ u(x,t) = 2/3 + \sum_{n=1}^n e^{-\lambda_n t} 
                                a_n(0) \big(\sqrt{2} \cos(n\pi x) \big).\]

      Below we show this plot at the required times, based on taking the sum
      out to $N=20$.  While the number of terms in the series affects the accuracy
      of the solution in at early times, the importance of these extra terms 
      decreases as $t\to\infty$.

\item As is clear from the series formula in part~(b) and from the figures,
      as $t\to\infty$, $u(x,t) \to 2/3$ for all $x\in[0,1]$.

\item The existence of the limiting solution in part~(c) does not contradict
      the fact that $\lambda_0=0$.  There is no division by zero, as there is
      in the analogous steady-state problem $u_{xx} = f(x)$ with homogeneous
      Neumann conditions.  The addition of the source term adds energy to the
      system, effectively increasing the rate of change of temperature with 
      respect to time ($u_t$) by one unit.  
      This corresponds to the physical situation of pumping more
      energy into a bar that is insulated at both ends---and hence
      energy cannot escape.  Thus we expect the heat to grow as $t\to\infty$.

      The above paragraph is satisfactory for full credit, but we can actually
      be quite a bit more precise.  The eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$ contributes
      a constant term to the solution of the PDE $u_t=u_{xx}$, and this constant 
      will be nonzero provided $(u_0,\psi_0) = \int_0^1 u_0(x)\cdot 1 \, dx \ne 0$.
      If $u_0$ has `zero mean', i.e., $\int_0^1 u_0(x)\,dx = 0$, then the solution
      to the homogeneous problem will decay as $t\to\infty$; otherwise, as $t\to\infty$
      the solution will approach the nonzero constant $(u_0,\psi_0)$.

      To write down the solution to the general inhomogeneous equation $u_t = u_{xx} + f$,
      we must expand
      \[ f(x,t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(t) \psi_n(x).\]
      The the coefficients $a_n(t)$ in the expansion of the solution
      \[ u(x,t) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n(t) \psi_n(x)\]
      obey the differential equation
      \[ a_n'(t) = -\lambda_n a_n(t) + c_n(t).\]
      As seen in class, these ODEs have the solutions
      \[ a_n(t) = e^{-\lambda_n t} a_n(0) + \int_0^t e^{-\lambda_n (t-\tau)} c_n(\tau)\,d\tau.\]
      The $a_0(t)$ case is particularly interesting: $a_0(t) = a_0(0) + \int_0^t c_0(\tau)\, d\tau$.
      Hence we cannot possibly have a steady state solution if $c_0(\tau)$ is bounded away from zero for all $\tau>0$.
 
      In the case of $f(x,t) = 1$, we have $c_0(t) = 1$ and $c_n(t) = 0$ for $n>0$, so that 
     \[ a_0(t) = a_0(0) + \int_0^t 1\, d\tau = a_0(0)+t;\]
      and for $n>0$,
     \[ a_n(t) = e^{-\lambda_n t}a_n(0),\]
      thus giving the solution
      \[ u(x,t) = a_0(0)+t + \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-\lambda_n t} a_n(0) \psi_n(x).\]
