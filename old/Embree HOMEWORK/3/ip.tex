For each example, we shall check all three properties required for an inner product.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{This function is not an inner product}:
      it is not symmetric and $(u,u)$ need not be positive.\\
      {[\textbf{GRADERS}: deduct 2~points if a student only identifies
        one of the two failed properties.]}\\
      The function $\ip{u,v}$ is not symmetric.
       For example, if $u(x) = 1$ and $v(x) = x$, then
         \[ (u,v) = \int_0^1 u(x) v'(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 1\, dx = 1,\]
       yet
         \[ (v,u) = \int_0^1 v(x) u'(x) \, dx = \int_0^1 0\, dx = 0.\]
       The function also fails to satisfy the nonnegativity requirement:
       For example, if $u(x) = 1$, then $(u,u) = 0$; if $u(x) = 1-x$,
       then
         \[ (u,u) = \int_0^1 (1-x)(-1)\, dx = -1/2.\]
      {[\textbf{GRADERS}: students need only to show that $(u,u)=0$ for nonzero $u$,
        or $(u,u)<0$ for some $u$.  They need not show both.]}
       
       For what it is worth, we note that $\ip{u,v}$ is linear:
         \[ \ip{\alpha u + \beta v, w}
                = \alpha \int_0^1 u(x) w'(x) \,dx + \beta\int_0^1 v(x) w'(x)\,dx
                = \alpha\ip{u,w} + \beta\ip{v,w}. \]
   
\item \emph{This function is not an inner product}: it is not linear.\\
     The function $(u,v)$ is symmetric, as 
     \[ \ip{u,v} = \int_0^1 |u(x)| |v(x)|\, d x
                 =  \int_0^1 |v(x)| |u(x)| \, d x = \ip{v,u}.\]
     However, it is not linear:
     \[ \ip{\alpha u,w} = \int_0^1 |\alpha u(x)| |w(x)|\, d x
                 =  \int_0^1 |\alpha| |u(x)| |w(x)| \, d x = |\alpha| \ip{u,w}.\]  
      If $u,w\ne 0$ and $\alpha<0$, then we have $\ip{\alpha u, w} \ne \alpha \ip{u,w}$.

      The function $\ip{u,u}$ is nonnegative and positive when $u\ne 0$:  
             \[ (u,u) = \int_0^1 |u(x)|^2\, dx\]
      is the integral of a nonnegative function, and hence is nonnegative;
      $(u,u)=0$ if and only if $u(x)=0$ for all $x$, i.e., $u=0$.
     
\item \emph{This function is an inner product.}\\
     The function $(u,v)$ is symmetric, as 
     \[ \ip{u,v} = \int_0^1 u(x) v(x) e^{-x}\, d x
                 =  \int_0^1 v(x) u(x) e^{-x} \, d x = \ip{v,u}.\]
      Similarly, the function is also linear:
     \begin{eqnarray*}
      \ip{\alpha u + \beta v, w} = \int_0^1 (\alpha u(x) + \beta v(x)) w(x) e^{-x}\, d x \\[0.5em]
                 &=&  \alpha \int_0^1 u(x)w(x) e^{-x}\, dx
                   +  \beta \int_0^1 v(x)w(x) e^{-x}\, dx \\[0.5em]
                 &=& \alpha \ip{u,w} + \beta \ip{v,w}.
     \end{eqnarray*}
      Lastly, we check
          \[ (u,u) = \int_0^1 u(x)^2 e^{-x} d x.\]
      The function $e^{-x}$ is positive valued on $[0,1]$, so we have 
      that $(u,u)$ is the integrand of a nonnegative function, and hence
      is also nonnegative.  If $(u,u) = 0$, then $u(x)^2 e^{-x} = 0$ for all $x\in[0,1]$,
      which means that $u(x)=0$ for all such $x$, i.e., $u=0$.
     
\item \emph{This function is not an inner product}: 
      it is not linear in the first component, and $(u,u)$ need not be positive.\\
      {[\textbf{GRADERS}: deduct 2~points if a student only identifies
        one of the two failed properties.]}\\
       To test linearity, consider 
         \[ \ip{u + v, w} 
                = \int_0^1 \big(u(x)+v(x)\big) + w(x) \,dx 
                = \int_0^1 u(x) + w(x) \,dx 
                   + \int_0^1 v(x)\,dx
                = \ip{u,w} + \int_0^1 v(x)\,dx.\]
        For most choices of $v$ and $w$ (for example, $v(x)=w(x)=1$), 
        $\int_0^1 v(x) \,dx \ne \ip{v,w}$, so $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is not linear.
      The function $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}$ also fails to satisfy the nonnegativity requirement.
       For example, if $u(x) = -1$,  then
         \[ (u,u) = \int_0^1 \big(u(x)+ u(x)\big) \, dx = \int_0^1 -2\, dx = -2 < 0.\]

       For what it is worth, note that $\ip{u,v}$ symmetric: $\ip{u,v}=\ip{v,u}$.
