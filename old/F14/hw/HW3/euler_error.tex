This problem will aim to show how the error in Forwards/Backwards Euler methods grows over time.  

Consider the time-dependent heat equation
\begin{align*}
\pd{u}{t}{}-\kappa\pd{u}{x}{2} &= 0, \quad x\in (0,1)\\
u(0,t) &= u_0\\
u(1,t) &= u_1\\
u(x,0) &= \sin(\pi x).
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine the constant $\alpha$ such that
\[
u(x,t) = e^{\alpha t}\sin(\pi x)
\]
is a solution to the time-dependent heat equation with the above initial and boundary conditions.  % \alpha = -\kappa\pi^2
\item Let us discretize using finite differences in space, but not in time.  In other words, we will specify grid points $x_i$, and let
\[
\pd{u(x_i,t)}{x}{2} \approx \frac{u_{i+1}(t) - 2u_i(t) + u_{i-1}(t)}{h^2}.
\]
Substituting this into the heat equation gives, for $\vec{u}_i(t) = u_i(t)$,
\[
\frac{d \vec{u}(t)}{dt} + A\vec{u}(t) = 0
\]
where
\[
A = {\kappa\over h^2} \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
              2 & -1 \\[0.25em]
               -1 & 2 & -1 \\
                 &  -1  & 2 & \ddots \\
                 & & \ddots & \ddots & -1 \\[0.25em]
                 & & & -1 & 2 
               \end{array}\right]
\]
In other words, by \emph{discretizing in space but not in time}, we end up with a system of ODEs.  From CAAM 335/Math 211, the exact solution to this system of ODEs can be written as
\[
\vec{u}(t) = e^{-At}.
\]
This can be computed in \textsc{Matlab} using the command \verb+expm(-A*t)+.
