Differential equation involving the second derivative operator are sometimes paired with mixed boundary conditions. Define the set 
\[ 
C_m^2[a,b]=\left\{ u \in C^2[a,b]: u(a)= \frac{du}{dx}(b)=0\right\}
\]

and define $L_m : C_m^2[a,b] \rightarrow C[a,b]$ by

\[
L_m u = -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}. 
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $C_m^2[a,b]$ is a subspace of $C^2[a,b]$ 
\item Determine the null space of $L_m$
\item Explain how to solve $L_m u = f$ for $u$, when $f$ is a given function in $C[a,b]$. (Hint:Integrate twice.) Is this differential equation is solvable for every $f\in C[a,b]$ ?
\item Explain what happens if question was given by following way.
\[ 
C_{\tilde{m}}^2[a,b]=\left\{ u \in C^2[a,b]: \frac{du}{dx}(a)=u(b)=0\right\}
\]
and $L_{\tilde{m}} : C_{\tilde{m}}^2[a,b] \rightarrow C[a,b]$ by

\[
L_{\tilde{m}} u = -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}. 
\]

\end{enumerate}
