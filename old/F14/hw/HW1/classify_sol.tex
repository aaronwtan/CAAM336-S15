\begin{solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1.1)][4 points] ODE, first order, linear, homogeneous, variable coefficient\\
      The $2/x$ factor in front of the $v$ is the variable coefficient.
\item[(1.2)][4 points] PDE, first order, linear, inhomogeneous, constant coefficient\\
      The $x-t$ term on the right, which does not involve $v$, makes the
      equation inhomogeneous.
\item[(1.3)][4 points] PDE, second order, nonlinear\\
      Using the product rule for partial derivatives, we can write this
      equation in the equivalent form
        \[ {\partial u \over \partial t} 
            - 2 \left({\partial u \over \partial x}\right)^{\!\!2}
            - 2 u \left({\partial^2 u \over \partial x^2}\right) = 0.\]
      The second and third terms on the left hand side 
      make this equation nonlinear.
\item[(1.4)][4 points] PDE, third order, nonlinear\\
      The $u(\partial u / \partial x)$ term makes this equation nonlinear.
      This a version of the famous Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation that 
      describes shallow water waves.
\item[(1.5)][4 points] ODE, second order, nonlinear\\
      The $(1-y^2) (dy/dx)$ term makes this ODE nonlinear.
\item[(1.6)][4 points] ODE, fourth order, linear, inhomogeneous, variable coefficient\\
      Using the product rule for partial derivatives, we can write this
      equation in the equivalent form
      \[
2 {d^2u \over dx^2} 
              + 4x {d^3 u \over dx^3}
              + x^2{d^4 u\over dx^4} = \sin(x),\]
      hence we can see that it is fourth order.
