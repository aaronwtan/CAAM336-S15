A Bernoulli differential equation (named after James
Bernoulli) is of the form
 \[ \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x) y^n \]
Observe that, if $n=0$ or $n=1$, the Bernoulli equation is linear. For other values of $n$, show that the substitution $u=y^{1-n}$ transforms the Bernoulli equation into the linear equation

\[\frac{du}{dx} + (1-n)P(x)u =(1-n)Q(x)\]
