Let
\[
H^1_D(0,1)=\left\{w\in H^1(0,1):\,w(0)=w(1)=0\right\}

be defined by
\[
\ip{v,w}=\int_0^1v(x)w(x)\,dx

and the energy inner product $a\ip{\cdot,\cdot}$ %:H^1_D(0,1)\times H^1_D(0,1)\to\R$ 
be defined by
\[
a\ip{v,w}=\int_0^1v'(x)w'(x)\,dx.
\]
Also, let $f\in L^2(0,1)$, let N be a positive integer, and let $V_N$ be a subspace of $H^1_D(0,1)$. Moreover, let $u\in H^1_D(0,1)$ be such that
\[
a\ip{u,v}=\ip{f,v}\mbox{ for all }v\in H^1_D(0,1)
\]
and let $u_N\in V_N$ be such that
\[
a\ip{u_N,v}=\ip{f,v}\mbox{ for all }v\in V_N.

\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that
\[
a\ip{u-u_N,u-u_N}=a\ip{u,u}-a\ip{u_N,u_N}.
\]
\\
\item Let $\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_N\in V_N$ and let $\BK\in\R^{N\times N}$ be the matrix with entries $K_{jk}=a(\phi_k,\phi_j)$ for $j,k=1,\ldots,N$. Also, let
\[
u_N=\sum_{j=1}^Nc_j\phi_j
\]
where $c_j\in\R$ is the $j$th entry of the vector $\Bc\in\R^N$. Show that
\[
\Bc^T\BK\Bc=a\ip{u_N,u_N}.
