Demonstrate whether or not each of the following is a linear operator.
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f:\R^n\to \R^m$ defined by $f(\Bu) = \BA \Bu + \Bb$ for a fixed matrix $\BA\in\Rmn$ and fixed nonzero vector $\Bb\in\Rm$.
\\
\item $f:\R^2 \to \R$ defined by $f(\Bx) = \Bx^T \Bx$.
\\
\item $f:\Rnn\to \Rnn$ defined by $f(\BX) = \BA\BX + \BX\BB$ for fixed matrices $\BA, \BB\in\Rnn$.
\\
\item $L: C^1[0,1] \to C[0,1]$ defined by $\displaystyle{ (Lu)(x) = u(x)u'(x)}$.
\\
\item $L: C^2[0,1] \to C[0,1]$ defined by $\displaystyle{ (Lu)(x) = u''(x) - \sin(x)u'(x) + \cos(x) u(x)}$.
\end{enumerate}
