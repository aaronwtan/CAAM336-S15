Let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:C[0,1]\times C[0,1]\to\R$ be defined by
\[
\ip{v,w}=\int_0^1v(x)w(x)\,dx.
\]
Consider the linear operator $L:C_m^2[0,1] \to C[0,1]$ defined by
\[
L u = -u''
\]
where 
\[
C_m^2[0,1] = \left\{ u\in C^2[0,1]: u'(0) = u(1) = 0\right\}.
\]
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Is $L$ symmetric?
\\
\item What is the null space of $L$?
\\
\item Show that $(L u,u)\ge 0$ for all $u\in C_m^2[0,1]$ and explain why this and the answer to part (b) mean that $\lambda > 0$ for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $L$.
\\
\item Find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $L$.
\end{enumerate}
