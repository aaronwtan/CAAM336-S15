Using Backward Euler method we can approximate second derivative as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{x^2}= \frac{\partail }{\partial x} \left(\frac{\partail u}{\partial x}\right)&\approx& \frac{\partail }{\partial x} \left(\frac{ u(x)-u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x}\right}\\
&=& \frac{\frac{ u(x)-u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x}-\frac{ u(x)-u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x}}{\Delta x}
\end{eqnarray*} 
and 
$$u(x-\Delta x) = u(x) - u'(x)\Delta x + \frac{u''(x)}{2}\Delta x^2 - \frac{u'''(x)}{3!}\Delta x^3 + \ldots$$ 
show that the second order finite difference approximation
\[
u''(x) \approx \frac{u(x+\Delta x)-2u(x) + u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
\]
has accuracy $O(\Delta x^2)$.  In other words, if $u''(x)$ is the exact second derivative, show that 
$$\left| u''(x) - \frac{u(x+\Delta x)-2u(x) + u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}\right| = O(\Delta x^2).$$

\begin{solution}

Adding together the Taylor expansions 
\begin{align*}
u(x+\Delta x) &= u(x) + u'(x)\Delta x + \frac{u''(x)}{2}\Delta x^2 + \frac{u'''(x)}{3!}\Delta x^3 + \ldots\\
u(x-\Delta x) &= u(x) - u'(x)\Delta x + \frac{u''(x)}{2}\Delta x^2 - \frac{u'''(x)}{3!}\Delta x^3 + \ldots
\end{align*}
gives 
\[
u(x+\Delta x) + u(x-\Delta x) = 2u(x) + u''(x)\Delta x^2 + 2\frac{u''''(x)}{4!}\Delta x^4 + \ldots.
\]
Subtracting $2u(x)$ from both sides and dividing by $\Delta x^2$ gives
\[
\frac{u(x+\Delta x) -2u(x) + u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2} = u''(x) + 2\frac{u''''(x)}{4!}\Delta x^2 + \ldots,
\]
implying that the truncation error decreases at the same rate that $\Delta x^2$ decreases (if $\Delta x$ is small enough).  This implies the 2nd order central finite difference formula is $O(\Delta x^2)$ accurate.
