1-D homogeneous steady state heat equation is given as follows \[\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}=0 \qquad for \qquad x\in[a,b].\] In that special case it can be called Laplace equation.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the solution of Laplace's equation in one dimension gives a linear potential function. 
\item Using the fact that in (a), observe that the maximum of the solution $u$ in the given interval is to be found on the boundary of the interval. Based on that information prove that Laplace equation has unique solution in the given interval. \\
Hint for(b): Assume that there are two different solutions.

\end{enumerate}
