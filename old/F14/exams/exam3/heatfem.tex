Let $\epsilon$ denote some constant, and consider the differential equation
\[
u_t (x, t) - u_{xx} (x, t) - \epsilon u(x, t) = f(x, t)
\]
for $0 \leq x \leq 1$, and $t \geq 0$, with boundary conditions
\[
u(0, t) = u_x(1, t) = 0
\]
and initial condition
\[u(x, 0) = \psi(x)\]
Describe how to solve this differential equation using the finite element method.
Provide as much detail as you can about the following points.

\begin{enumerate}

\item What is the weak form of this differential equation?

\item State the Galerkin problem based on the approximating subspace $V_N = span{\phi_1, . . . , \phi_N }$
for linearly independent basis functions $\phi_1, . . . , \phi_N .$

\item Show how this problem leads to a differential equation of the form
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{M} a'(t) + \mathbf{K } a(t) &= \mathbf{f}(t), \\
										a(0) &= a_0, 
 \end{align*}
 
 where you should specify the entries of $\mathbf{M}$, $\mathbf{K}$, $\mathbf{f}$ and $a_0$.
\item Describe how to solve this equation using the backward Euler method.
\item Does the solution you obtain depend on the choice of the basis functions $\phi_1, . . . , \phi_N $?
\item Describe how your method would change if the equation had inhomogeneous Dirichlet
boundary conditions,
\[
u(0, t) = a, u_x(1, t) = b.
\]
for the constants $a$ and $b$.
