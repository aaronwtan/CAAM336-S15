%Using Backward Euler method we can approximate second derivative as follows
%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}= \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)&\approx& \frac{\partial }{\partial x} \left(\frac{ u(x)-u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x}\right)\\
%&\approx& \frac{\frac{ u(x)-u(x-\Delta x)}{\Delta x}-\frac{ u(x-\Delta x)-u(x-2 \Delta x)}{\Delta x}}{\Delta x}\\
%&=& \frac{ u(x)-2 u(x-\Delta x) + u(x-2 \Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
%\end{eqnarray*} 
%Then 
%\[ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{ u(x)-2 u(x-\Delta x) + u(x-2 \Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
%\]
%where the term $\Delta x = x_{i+1}-x_{i}= x_{i}-x_{i-1}$ represents a constant spatial interval.

In this problem, we will investigate the order of accuracy for an alternative finite difference approximation for the second derivative.  Let $u(x)$ be a smooth function with the Taylor series expansion around the point $x$
\[
u(x+\Delta x) = u(x) + u'(x)\Delta x + \frac{u''(x)}{2}\Delta x^2 + \frac{u'''(x)}{3!}\Delta x^3 + \ldots 
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Derive the finite difference approximation to $u''(x)$
\[
u''(x) \approx \frac{u(x)-2u(x-\Delta x) + u(x-2\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
\]
with backwards difference formulas.  In other words, approximate $u''(x) = (u'(x))'$ using a backwards difference formula involving the terms
\[
u'(x), \quad u'(x-\Delta x),
\]
and then approximate $u'(x)$ and $u'(x-\Delta x)$ using backwards difference formulas involving 
\[
u(x),\quad u(x-\Delta x), \quad u(x-2\Delta x).
\]
\item Show that the second order backward finite difference approximation
\[
u''(x) \approx \frac{u(x)-2u(x-\Delta x) + u(x-2\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}
\]
has accuracy $O(\Delta x)$.  In other words, if $u''(x)$ is the exact second derivative, show that 
$$\left| u''(x) - \frac{u(x)-2u(x-\Delta x) + u(x-2\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}\right| = O(\Delta x).$$

\item Show that the 3-point forward difference formula for $u'(x)$
\[
u'(x) \approx \frac{-3u(x) + 4u(x+\Delta x) - u(x+ 2\Delta x)}{2\Delta x}
\]
has accuracy $O(\Delta x^2)$.  (In general, the more points a finite difference formula involves, the higher the order of accuracy, which is why the 3 point forward difference is more accurate than the $O(\Delta x)$ two-point forward difference formula.)
%\item Another finite difference formula is the four point backward finite difference formula for the second derivative, given as 
%\[
%u''(x) \approx \frac{2u(x)-5u(x-\Delta x) + 4 u(x-2\Delta x)-u(x-3\Delta x)}{\Delta x^2}.
%\]
%Show that this approximation has accuracy $O(\Delta x^2)$.
