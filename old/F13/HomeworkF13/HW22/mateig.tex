Suppose that
  \[ \BA = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & -1 & 0\end{array}\right].\]
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Compute by hand the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix.
\\
\item Choose three eigenvectors of $\BA$, one corresponding to each eigenvalue of $\BA$, and verify by hand that these eigenvectors are orthogonal.
\\
\item Solve the linear system $\BA\Bx = \Bb$ using the spectral method, where
       \[ \Bb = \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ -1 \\ 3\end{array}\right].\]
\end{enumerate}
