\begin{enumerate}
\item In class we considered the forward difference approximation
      \[ u'(x) \approx {u(x+h) - u(x) \over h}.\]
      For $u(x) = \exp(2x)$, compute (in MATLAB) the error
         \[ \Big| u'(1/2) -  {u(1/2+h) - u(1/2) \over h}\Big|,\]
      for $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots, 512$ (powers of~2) with $h=1/(N+1)$. In class, we showed that, when $h$ is small enough, this error should be proportional to $h$. Present your results in a table like the one below but with the missing entries filled in.

\item Consider the centered difference approximation
      \[ u'(x) \approx {u(x+h) - u(x-h) \over 2 h}.\]
      For $u(x) = \exp(2x)$, compute (in MATLAB) the error
         \[ \Big| u'(1/2) -  {u(1/2+h) - u(1/2-h) \over 2h}\Big|\]
      for $N = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots, 512$ (powers of~2) with $h=1/(N+1)$. When $h$ is small enough, this error should be proportional to $h^2$. Present your results in a table like the one below but with the missing entries filled in.

\begin{tabular}{r|r}

\multicolumn{1}{c|}{$N$} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{error} \\

\item Use MATLAB's \verb|loglog| command to produce a plot of $N$ versus the corresponding error for the approximations considered in part~(a) and part~(b). Use the \verb|hold on| command so that the plot showing the errors from part (a) is on the same figure as the plot showing the errors from part (b).

\vspace*{1em} 
\item By inspecting the plot you have created, estimate the value of $N$ that you
      need to approximate $u'(1/2)$ to an error of $10^{-2}$ using the approximations
      in part~(a) and part~(b).
