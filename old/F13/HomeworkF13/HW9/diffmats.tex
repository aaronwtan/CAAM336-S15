Suppose $N\ge 1$ is an integer and define $h = 1/(N+1)$ and $x_j = jh$ for $j=0,\ldots, N+1$.

We can approximate the differential equation
\[ {d^2 \over dx^2} u = f(x), \quad x\in (0,1),\]
with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions $u(0)=u(1) = 0$ by the matrix equation
\[ {1\over h^2} \left[\begin{array}{rrrrr}
              -2 & 1 \\[0.25em]
               1 & -2 & 1 \\
                 &  1  & -2 & \ddots \\
                 & & \ddots & \ddots & 1 \\[0.25em]
                 & & & 1 & -2 
               \end{array}\right]
          \left[\begin{array}{c} u_1 \\[0.25em] u_2 \\[0.25em] \vdots \\[0.25em] u_{N-1} \\[0.25em] u_N \end{array}\right]
 =   \left[\begin{array}{c} f(x_1) \\[0.25em] f(x_2) \\[0.25em] \vdots \\[0.25em] f(x_{N-1}) \\[0.25em] f(x_N) \end{array}\right],\]
where $u_j \approx u(x_j)$.  (Entries of the matrix that are not specified are zero.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose that $f(x) = 25 \pi^2 \cos (5\pi x)$.

Compute and plot the approximate solutions obtained when $N=8, 16, 32, 64, 128$.

To solve the linear systems, you may use MATLAB's `backslash' command: \verb| u = A\f|.
\\
\item For each value of $N$ used in part~(a) compute the maximum error $|u_j - u(x_j)|$, given that the true solution is
\[u(x) = 1-2x-\cos(5\pi x).\]
Plot this error using a \verb|loglog| plot with error on the vertical axis and $N$ on the horizontal axis.
\\
\item Explain what adjustments to the right hand side of the matrix equation are necessary to accommodate the inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions
\[ u(0)=1,\quad  u(1)=2.\]
\\
\item Compute and plot the approximate solutions obtained when
\[ u(0)=1,\quad  u(1)=2\]
with $N=8, 32, 128$.
\end{enumerate}
