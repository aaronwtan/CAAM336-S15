Let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\times C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\ip{v,w}=\int_0^1v(x)w(x)\,dx
\]
and let the norm $\norm{\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\norm{v}=\sqrt{\ip{v,v}}.
\]
Let the linear operator $L: S\to C[0,1]$ be defined by
\[
L v = -v''
\]
where
\[
S = \{ w \in C^2[0,1] : w(0) = w'(1) = 0\}.
\]
Note that
\[
\ip{Lv,w}=\ip{v,Lw}\mbox{ for all }v,w\in S.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item The operator $L$ has eigenvalues $\lambda_n$ with corresponding eigenfunctions
\[
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin\left(\left(n-{1\over 2}\right)\pi x\right)
\]
for $n=1,2,\ldots$. Obtain a formula for the eigenvalues $\lambda_n$ for $n=1,2,\ldots$.
\\
\item Use the spectral method to obtain a series solution to the problem of finding $\tilde{u}\in C^2[0,1]$ such that
\[
-\tilde{u}''(x) = x + \sin(\pi x),\quad 0<x<1
\]
and
\[
\tilde{u}(0) = \tilde{u}'(1) = 0.
\]
Note that, for $m,n=1,2,\ldots$,
\[
\ip{\psi_m,\psi_n}=\left\{\begin{array}{rl}1&\mbox{if }m=n;\\0&\mbox{if }m\ne n.\end{array}\right.
\]

\item Plot the approximation to $\tilde{u}$ obtained by replacing the upper limit of the summation in your series solution with $20$.
\\
\item By shifting the data, obtain a series solution to the problem of finding $u\in C^2[0,1]$ such that
\[
-u''(x) = x + \sin(\pi x),\quad 0<x<1
\]
and
\[
u(0) = u'(1) = 1.
\]

\item Plot the approximation to $u$ obtained by replacing the upper limit of the summation in your series solution with $20$.
