Let $u$ be the solution of
\begin{eqnarray*}
 -u''(x) &=& f(x),\quad 0<x<1;
\\
 u'(0) &=& \alpha;
\\
u(1) &=& \beta;
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\alpha,\beta\in\R$ and
\[
f(x)=12x^2-24x+4.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use integration and the boundary conditions to compute the solution $u$.

\vspace*{1em}
\item Plot $u$ in the case when $\alpha=\beta=0$.

\vspace*{1em}
\item Plot $u$ in the case when $\alpha = -1$ and $\beta = 1$.

\end{enumerate}
