Parts (a) and (c) of this question should be done by hand.

Let
\[
f(x,t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
2x & \displaystyle{\mbox{if }x\in\left[0,{1 \over 2}\right)},
\\[10pt]
2-2x & \displaystyle{\mbox{if }x\in\left[{1 \over 2},1\right]}.
\end{array}\right.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the spectral method to obtain a series solution to the problem of finding the solution $\tilde{u}(x,t)$ to the heat equation
\[
\tilde{u}_t(x,t)-\tilde{u}_{xx}(x,t) = f(x,t),\quad 0<x<1,\quad t>0
\]
with Neumann boundary conditions
\[
\tilde{u}_x(0,t) = \tilde{u}_x(1,t) = 0,\quad t\ge0
\]
and initial condition
\[
\tilde{u}(x,0)=0,\quad 0<x<1.
\]

\item Plot the approximations to $\tilde{u}(x,t)$ obtained by replacing the upper limit of the summation in your series solution with $20$ for $t=0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,1,2$.

\item By shifting the data and then using the spectral method, obtain a series solution to the problem of finding the solution $u(x,t)$ to the heat equation
\[
u_t(x,t)-u_{xx}(x,t) = f(x,t),\quad 0<x<1,\quad t>0
\]
with Neumann boundary conditions
\[
u_x(0,t) =0,\quad t\ge0
\]
and
\[
u_x(1,t) = 2,\quad t\ge0
\]
and initial condition
\[
u(x,0)=x^2,\quad 0<x<1.
\]

\item Plot the approximations to $u(x,t)$ obtained by replacing the upper limit of the summation in your series solution with $20$ for $t=0,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,1,2$.
