Let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[-1,1]\times C[-1,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
(u,v) = \int_{-1}^1 u(x) v(x)\,dx.
\]
Let the linear operator $P_e:\mbox{ }C[-1,1]\rightarrow C[-1,1]$ be defined by
\[
(P_e f)(x) = {f(x) + f(-x) \over 2}
\]
and let the linear operator $P_o:\mbox{ }C[-1,1]\rightarrow C[-1,1]$ be defined by
\[
(P_o f)(x) = {f(x) - f(-x) \over 2}.
\]
Note that $P_e$ and $P_o$ project functions onto their even and odd parts, respectively.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Verify that $P_e$ and $P_o$ are projections.
\\
\item For all $f\in C[-1,1]$, verify that $P_e f$ and $P_o f$ are orthogonal with respect to the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}$.
\\
\item Is $P_e+P_o$ a projection? Note that $P_e+P_o:\mbox{ }C[-1,1]\rightarrow C[-1,1]$ is defined by $(P_e+P_o)f=P_ef+P_of$.
\end{enumerate}
