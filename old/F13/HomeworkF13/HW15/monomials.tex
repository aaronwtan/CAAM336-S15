Suppose $\CV$ is a vector space with an associated inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }\CV\times\CV\rightarrow\R$ and norm $\norm{\cdot}:\mbox{ }\CV\rightarrow\R$ defined by $\norm{w}=\sqrt{\ip{w,w} }$. The angle $\angle(u,v)$ between $u \in \CV$ and $v \in \CV$ is defined via the equation
\[ \ip{u,v} = \norm{u} \norm{v} \cos \angle(u,v).\]
Let $\CV=C[0,1]$ and let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\times C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by $\ip{u,v} = \int_0^1 u(x) v(x)\, dx$. Let $m$ and $n$ be nonnegative integers.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\ip{x^n,x^m}$.
\\
\item Compute $\norm{x^m}$ and $\norm{x^n}$.
\\
\item Compute $\cos \angle(x^n,x^m)$ between $x^n$ and $x^m$.
\\
\item Compute $\cos \angle(x^n,x^{n+1})$ between $x^n$ and $x^{n+1}$.
\\
\item What happens to $\angle(x^n,x^{n+1})$ as $n\to\infty$ ?
\end{enumerate}
