Let the inner product $\ip{\cdot,\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\times C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\ip{v,w}=\int_0^1v(x)w(x)\,dx
\]
and let the norm $\norm{\cdot}:\mbox{ }C[0,1]\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\norm{v}=\sqrt{\ip{v,v}}.
\]
Let the linear operator $L: C^2_D[0,1]\to C[0,1]$ be defined by
\[
L v = -v''
\]
where
\[
C^2_D[0,1] = \{ w \in C^2[0,1] : w(0) = w(1) = 0\}.
\]
Recall that the operator $L$ has eigenvalues
\[
\lambda_n = n^2 \pi^2
\]
with corresponding eigenfunctions
\[
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin(n \pi x)
\]
for $n=1,2,\ldots$. Let $N$ be a positive integer, let $f\in C[0,1]$ be defined by $f(x) = x^2(1-x)$ and let $u$ be the solution to
\[
Lu=f.
\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute the best approximation $f_N$ to $f$ from ${\rm span}\left\{\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_N\right\}$ with respect to the norm $\norm{\cdot}$.
\\
\item Use the spectral method to compute the best approximation $u_N$ to $u$ from ${\rm span}\left\{\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_N\right\}$ with respect to the norm $\norm{\cdot}$.
\\
\item Produce a plot comparing $f$ to $f_N$ for $N=1,2,3,4,5,6$.
\\
\item Plot the approximations $u_N$ to $u$ that you obtained using the spectral method for $N=1,2,3,4,5,6$.
\\
\item Write down the series solution to
\[
Lu=f
\]
that is obtained using the spectral method.
\\
\item By shifting the data and then using a series solution that you have obtained previously in this question, obtain a series solution to the problem of finding $\tilde{u}\in C^2[0,1]$ such that
\[
-\tilde{u}''(x)=f(x),\quad 0<x<1;
\]
\[
\tilde{u}(0) = -{1\over 100}
\]
and
\[
\tilde{u}(1) = {1\over 100}.
\]
\item Let $\tilde{u}_N$ be the series solution that you obtained in part (f) but with $\infty$ replaced by $N$. Plot $\tilde{u}_N$ for $N=1,2,3,4,5,6$.
\end{enumerate}
