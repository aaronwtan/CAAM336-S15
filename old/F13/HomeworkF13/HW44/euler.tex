Let the norm $\norm{\cdot}:\mbox{ }\R^2\rightarrow\R$ be defined by
\[
\norm{\By} = \sqrt{\By\cdot \By}.
\]
Let
\[
\BA = \left[\begin{array}{cc}0 & 1 \\ 1 &  0\end{array}\right]
\]
and consider the problem of finding $\Bx(t)$ such that
\[
\Bx'(t) = \BA\Bx(t),\quad t>0
\]
and
\[
\Bx(0) = \left[\begin{array}{c}2 \\ 0\end{array}\right].
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute $\Bx(t)$.
\\
\item How does $\norm{\Bx(t)}$ behave as $t\to\infty$?
\end{enumerate}
