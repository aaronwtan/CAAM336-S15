This question addresses the problem $-u''(x) = f(x)$
for $x\in[0,1]$ with Neumann boundary conditions: $u'(0)=u'(1)=0$.  
Let 
\[ V = C^2_N[0,1] = \{ u \in C^2[0,1]: u'(0)=u'(1)=0\},\]
with the inner product
\[    (u,v) = \int_0^1 u(x) v(x)\,dx.\]
Define the operator $L:V \to C[0,1]$ by 
\[ Lu = -u'', \qquad u'(0)=u'(1)=0.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is $L$ symmetric?

\vspace*{.5em}
\item What is the null space of $L$?  That is, describe all vectors 
      $v\in V$ such that $L v = 0$.

\vspace*{.5em}
\item Compute all the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of $L$.

\vspace*{.5em}
\item Now suppose we wish to solve $Lu = f$ for the unknown $u$.  
      State the conditions on $f$ for which this problem has:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item no solutions;
      \item infinitely many solutions;
      \item a unique solution.
      \end{itemize}

\vspace*{.5em}
\item Suppose $f$ is some function such that $Lu = f$ has infinitely many solutions.\\
      Using the spectral method (and other terms as appropriate),
      write down a general formula for all of them.

\vspace*{.5em}
\item Now pose the problem $-u'' = f$ with Neumman boundary
      conditions $u'(0)=u'(1)=0$ as before, but additionally require solutions
      to satisfy $\int_0^1 u(x)\,dx = 0$ (that is, to have an average value of zero).   
      We call the resulting operator $\widehat{L}$, which operates on the space
      \[ \widehat{V} = \{ u \in C^2[0,1]: \mbox{$u'(0)=u'(1)=0$ and $\int_0^1 u(x)\,d x=0$}\}.\]

      How do the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\widehat{L}$ differ
      from those of $L$ that you found in problem~(b)?
      Be precise.

\vspace*{.5em}
\item Suppose $\int_0^1 f(x)\,dx = 0$.  Write down the spectral method solution $u$ 
      to $\widehat{L} u = f$.



\end{enumerate}
