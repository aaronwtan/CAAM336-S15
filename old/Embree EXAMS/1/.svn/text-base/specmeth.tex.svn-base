Consider the equation
\[ -u''(x) = f(x), \quad x\in[0,1] \]
with a homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition on the left,
\[ u(0) = 0\]
and a homogeneous \emph{mixed} condition on the right,
\[ u(1) - u'(1) = 0.\]

Define the linear operator $L: V\to C[0,1]$ via $Lu = -u''$ with
\[ V = \{u\in C^2[0,1]: u(0)= u(1)-u'(1)=0\}.\]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that $L$ is symmetric.

\vspace*{1em}
\item Compute the eigenfunctions of $L$, and show that the eigenvalues 
      $\lambda$ must satisfy the equation
      \[ \tan(\sqrt{\lambda}) = \sqrt{\lambda}.\]
      [Recall that any function that satisfies $-\psi '' = \lambda \psi$ 
       must have the general form\\ $\psi(x) = A \sin(\sqrt{\lambda} x) + B \cos(\sqrt{\lambda} x)$.]

\vspace*{1em}
\item Is $\lambda=0$ an eigenvalue of $L$?

\vspace*{1em}
\item Draw a plot of $g(x) = \tan(x)$ for $x\in [0, 4\pi]$ and superimpose a plot of $h(x)=x$.\\
      Mark the points where these two plots intersect.

\vspace*{1em}
\item Use your plot in~(d) to argue that $L$ has infinitely many eigenvalues, \\
      with $(n-1)^2 \pi^2 < \lambda_n < n^2\pi^2$.
      What value does $\lambda_n$ tend to as $n\to\infty$?

\vspace*{1em}
\item Write down the spectral method solution to the equation
       \[ -u''(x) = f(x), \quad u(0) = u(1)-u'(1) = 0.\]
      (You do not need to work out numerical values for the inner products.)
      
\end{enumerate}
