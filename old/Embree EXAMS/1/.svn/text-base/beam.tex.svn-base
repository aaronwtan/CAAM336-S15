The Euler--Bernoulli beam equation equates the fourth derivative of
the deflection $u(x)$ of a thin uniform beam under the load $f(x)$:
\[ u''''(x) = f(x).\]
We seek solutions $u$ for a beam of length~1 that satisfies
the \emph{hinged} boundary conditions
\[ u(0) = u''(0) = u(1) = u''(1) = 0.\]
That is, we look for solutions $u\in C^4_H[0,1]$, where
\[ C^4_H[0,1] = \{ v\in C^4[0,1]: v(0)=v''(0)= v(1)=v''(1)=0\}.\]


\vspace*{1em} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prove that the operator $L$ defined by $Lu = u''''$ is
      symmetric on the space $C^4_H[0,1]$ with inner product
\[ (u,v) = \int_0^1 u(x) v(x)\,dx.\]

\vspace*{1em} 
\item Compute the eigenvalues $\{\lambda_n\}$ and eigenfunctions $\{\psi_n\}$ 
      of the operator $L$.\\  Hint:  the eigenfunctions must have the form
      \[ \psi_n(x) = A \sin(\omega_n x) + B \cos(\omega_n x),\]
      where the values of $A$, $B$, and/or $\omega_n$ are affected
      by the hinged boundary conditions.

\vspace*{1em}
\item Given the function $f(x) = 1$, compute the expansion in the eigenfunction basis,
      \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty c_n \psi_n(x).\]
       That is, explicitly compute a formula for the coefficients $c_n$. 

\vspace*{1em}
\item Use the spectral method to write down the solution to $Lu = f$ for
      $f(x) = 1$ in the form
      \[ u(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \gamma_n \psi_n(x).\]
      That is, specify the values of the coefficients $\gamma_n$.

\vspace*{1em}
\item Suppose you instead want to solve $u''''(x) = f(x)$ with
      boundary conditions
     \begin{eqnarray*}
        u(0) &=& \alpha, \qquad u(1) = 0 \\
        u''(0) &=& 0, \qquad \kern-4pt u''(1) = \beta.
     \end{eqnarray*}
     Explain how you can compute such a solution in the form $u(x) = \widehat{u}(x) + v(x)$,
     where $\widehat{u}(x)$ is a solution to the problem with \emph{homogeneous} hinged boundary
     conditions and $v(x)$ is some correction that you should specify as completely as possible.
\end{enumerate}
