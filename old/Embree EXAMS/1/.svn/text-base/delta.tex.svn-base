A classical problem in quantum mechanics models a particle moving in
an infinite square well, subject to an infinite potential at a point.
The result is a Schr\"odinger operator posed on $C^2_D[0,1]$ of the form
\[ L u = -u'' + \delta_{1/2} u,\]
where $\delta_{1/2}$ is a ``delta function'' centered at the location of
the infinite potential, $x=1/2$.  There is a beautiful theory behind these
exotic functions (more properly called \emph{distributions}).  For this bonus problem,
you need only know the following fact: for any function $g\in C[0,1]$,
\[ \int_0^1 \delta_{1/2}(x) g(x) \ d x = g(1/2).\]

The equation $Lu = f$ has the equivalent weak form
\[ a(u, w) = (f,w) \qquad \mbox{for all $w\in V = C^2_D[0,1]$},\]
where
\[ \kern6pt a(u,w) = \int_0^1 u'(x) w'(x) + \delta_{1/2}(x) u(x) w(x)\, d x.\]

We wish to use the Galerkin method to approximate solutions to $Lu = f$
from the finite dimensional subspace
$V_N = {\rm span}\{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_N\}$.
Take the basis vectors to be the eigenfunctions of the problem
without the infinite potential:
\[ \phi_k(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin(n \pi x).\]

For 5~bonus points, write out the stiffness matrix for $N=5$ in the simplest
possible form.
