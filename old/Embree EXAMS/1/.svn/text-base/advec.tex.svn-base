Many problems in fluid dynamics give rise to 
\emph{advection--diffusion} equations, the 
simplest example of which is
\[ u''(x) + c u'(x) = f(x),\]
for $x\in[0,1]$ with $u(0)=u(1) = 0$.
(The constant $c$ describes the strength with which
a fluid advects across the domain through the $cu'$ term;
the $u''$ term describes diffusion.) 

\vspace*{1em}
Define $L: C^2_D[0,1] \to C[0,1]$ by $L u = u'' + c u'$.
For all parts of this problem, presume that $c>0$, and use the standard
inner product
\[ (f,g) = \int_0^1 f(x) g(x)\,d x.\]

\vspace*{1em}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $L$ is symmetric, or provide a specific example
      to show that $L$ is not symmetric.

\vspace*{1em}
\item For constant $c$, the eigenfunctions of $L$ have the form
\[ \psi_n(x) = e^{-cx/2} \sin(n \pi x), \qquad n=1,2,\ldots.\]
Verify that $L \psi_n = \lambda_n \psi_n$ for some constant $\lambda_n$.\\
Be sure to clearly state a formula for the eigenvalue $\lambda_n$, 
and to verify that $\psi_n$ satisfies the boundary conditions.

\item Draw a \emph{rough} sketch that shows the 
      eigenfunctions $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$ for $c=10$.

\vspace*{1em}
\item How do you expect the angle between $\psi_1$ and $\psi_2$
      to vary with $c$\,?\\
      (Do not make any calculations, just give a sound argument
       based on the form of $\psi_n(x)$.)

\vspace*{1em}
\item Suppose we wish to solve $Lu = f$ in the special case that 
      $f$ is an eigenfunction, $f = \psi_n$.\\
      What is the solution $u$?
 
\end{enumerate}
