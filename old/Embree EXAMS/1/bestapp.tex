In class we considered inner products for vectors in $\R^n$ and
functions in $C[0,1]$, and used these inner products to generate
best approximations.  
This problem will introduce you to an inner product of \emph{matrices} 
in $\R^{n\times n}$.
(Related math arises in many modern applications;
e.g., at the roots of how Netflix recommends movies.) 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $V$ be a vector space endowed with an inner product, 
      and let $V_n = {\rm span}\{\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n\}$
      denote an $n$-dimensional subspace of $V$.
      We wish to approximate some vector $f\in V$.

      \begin{itemize}
       \item Explain how to compute $f_n = c_1 \phi_1 + \cdots + c_n \phi_n$,
             the best approximation to $f$ from $V_n$.
             (That is, explain how to determine the unknown coefficients
              $c_1, \ldots, c_n$.) 

       \item How does the procedure simplify when the
             basis vectors $\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_n$ are orthogonal?
      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

     For the rest of the problem, consider this specific case:
      Let $V = \R^{2\times 2}$, the set of all $2\times 2$ matrices,
      and define the inner product
      \[ (\BA,\BB) = \sum_{j=1}^2 \sum_{k=1}^2 a_{jk} b_{jk},\]
       where
      \[ \BA = \bmatrix{a_{11} & a_{12} \cr a_{21} & a_{22}}, \quad
         \BB = \bmatrix{b_{11} & b_{12} \cr b_{21} & b_{22}}.\]
      With this inner product we associate the norm $\|\BA\| = \sqrt{(\BA,\BA)}$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(b)] Verify that $(\cdot, \cdot)$ is an inner product on $V=\R^{2\times 2}$.

\item[(c)] Consider the subspace of $V$ consisting of all symmetric matrices:
      \[  V_3 = {\rm span}\bigg\{ 
       \bmatrix{1 & 0 \cr 0 & 0}, 
       \bmatrix{0 & 0 \cr 0 & 1}, 
       \bmatrix{0 & 1 \cr 1 & 0}\bigg\}.\]
      
      Compute the best approximation $\BM_3$ to the matrix
      \[ \BM = \bmatrix{ 1 & 3 \cr 7 & 9}\]
      from the subspace $V_3$.

\item[(d)] Now let $\BM\in\R^{2\times2}$ be any $2\times 2$ matrix, and let
           $\BM_3$ be its best approximation from $V_3$.
           Explain why the error $\BM-\BM_3$ must \emph{always} have zero 
           diagonal entries.

\item[(e)] Now consider the subspace
      \[  \widehat{V}_3 = {\rm span}\Bigg\{ 
       \bmatrix{{1\over\sqrt{2}}  & 0 \cr 0 & {1\over \sqrt{2}}}, 
       \bmatrix{{1\over\sqrt{10}} & {2\over\sqrt{10}} \cr {2\over\sqrt{10}} & {1\over \sqrt{10}}}, 
       \bmatrix{{1\over\sqrt{2}} & 0 \cr 0 & -{1\over\sqrt{2}}}\Bigg\}.\]
       What is the best approximation $\widehat{\BM}_3$ from $\widehat{V}_3$ to 
      \[ \BM = \bmatrix{ 1 & 3 \cr 7 & 9}\,?\]

\item[(f)] Write down a basis for the set of symmetric matrices in $\R^{3\times 3}$ (i.e., $3\times 3$ matrices).\\
       In general, what is the dimension of the set of symmetric matrices
       in $\R^{n\times n}$?
\end{enumerate}
