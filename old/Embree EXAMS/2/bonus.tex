In Problem~4 regarding the finite element discretization of the
two-dimensional domain, we imposed Neumann boundary conditions
and made a somewhat exotic choice for the basis functions 
$\phi_1, \ldots, \phi_4$.

Explain why we did not use the simpler Dirichlet boundary conditions:

What essential condition would the basis functions need to satisfy?

How would you generalize a hat function to two dimensions?
