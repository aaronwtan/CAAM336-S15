Heat equation - based on a question from Jonathan Zev

Suppose u_0(x) = x(1-x).
Then u_xx(x,0) = -2.
So u_t(x,0) = -2.
But this cannot be true at x=0 and x=1, since
u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0 is constant.

What gives?  Explore for an example.

CFL condition for fourth order equation...

What is the timestep restriction if you want
to ensure that the solution is positive, for the heat eqn?
