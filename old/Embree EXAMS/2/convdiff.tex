The challenge problem on Problem Set~5 introduced the 
steady-state \emph{convection--diffusion} equation, which arises often
in fluid dynamics.  Here we shall consider the time dependent version,
$$ u_t(x,t) = u_{xx}(x,t) + c@u_x(x,t) \eqno{(*)} $$
for $x\in[0,1]$ and $t\ge 0$ with
constant parameter $c$, boundary conditions $u(0,t)=u(1,t)=0$,
and initial condition $u(x,0) = u_0(x)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  The $c@u_x$ term prevents us from tackling this problem directly
       using the spectral method.  Instead, write $u(x,t)$ in the form
       \[ u(x,t) = e^{-cx/2} w(x,t).\]
      
       Show that $w$ satisfies the equation
       $$ w_t(x,t) = w_{xx}(x,t) - {c^2\over 4} w(x,t). \eqno{(**)} $$

       Specify the correct initial and boundary conditions for $w$.

\item  We now seek a series solution for $w$.

       Write the equation~$(**)$  in the form $w_t = - L w$. 
       Clearly define the operator $L$.
    
       The eigenfunctions of your $L$ should be the familiar $\psi_k(x) = \sqrt{2} \sin(k \pi x)$.\\
       Use these to compute the eigenvalues of $L$.
       Write down a full series solution for $w$,\\
       and from this write down a series solution for $u$.

\vspace*{1em}
\item  We now wish to solve the problem~$(*)$ with inhomogeneous Dirichlet 
       boundary conditions,
       $u(0,t) = \alpha$ and $u(1,t) = \beta e^{-c/2}$.

\smallskip
       As before, we will write $u(x,t) = e^{-cx/2}w(x,t)$, where now
       $w$ satisfies the inhomogeneous Dirichlet conditions
       $w(0,t) = \alpha$ and $w(1,t) = \beta$.

\smallskip
       Explain how to find the solution in the form $w(x,t) = \widehat{w}(x,t)+g(x)$,
       where $\widehat{w}$ satisfies homogeneous Dirichlet boundary
       conditions and solves the problem
       $\widehat{w}_t = - L \widehat{w} + f$.  
       Specify $f$, $g$, and the initial condition 
       $\widehat{w}_0(x) = \widehat{w}(x,0)$. 
       \emph{You do not need to solve for $\widehat{w}$.} 

\end{enumerate}
